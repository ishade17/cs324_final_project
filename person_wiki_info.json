In 2022, Croak was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for her patent regarding VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) Technology. She is one of the first two Black women to receive that honor, along with Patricia Bath. Her invention allows users to make calls over the internet instead of a phone line. Today, the widespread use of VoIP technology is vital for remote work and conferencing.",
        "Education and early career": "Croak was born on May 14, 1955, in New York City. Her father built her a home chemistry set, which inspired her to pursue a STEM career. She obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree from Princeton University in 1977 and a Ph.D. specializing in Quantitative Analysis and Psychology in 1982 from the University of Southern California. After college, she joined AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1982, where she worked in a variety of positions for over 3 decades.",
        "Career": "She started off in Bell\u2019s Human Factors division, with the specific purpose of studying how technology could be used to positively impact human\u2019s lives. Croak first began working on digital messaging applications, tasked with the study of determining if various messaging applications could communicate with each other. This kind of research was very novel, as the earliest form of the Internet would not come to full fruition until the next year in 1983. Bell Labs wanted to send voice, text, and video data digitally rather than using a standard phone line. And the favored mechanism for this was Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol, but Croak, along with the rest of her team, convinced AT&T to use TCP/IP instead. TCP/IP allowed for a standardized way of packaging and communicating information.\n\nWhile at AT&T, Croak and her team contemplated the potential of digital telecommunications. She worked on advancing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies, converting voice data into digital signals that can be easily transmitted over the internet rather than using traditional phone lines. Her work has furthered the capabilities of audio and video conferencing.  \nDuring her time at AT&T she patented the technology that allowed cellphone users to donate money to organizations using text messaging. She developed this technology during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and it revolutionized how people donate to charitable organizations when a natural disaster occurs. She received the 2013 Thomas Edison Patent Award for this technology. She was inspired to do this after seeing AT&T develop technology that helped American Idol set up a voting system that relied on text messages rather than voice calls, in 2003. The technology that she created with co-inventor Hossein Eslambolchi, was not finalized until October 2005, a couple of months after Hurricane Katrina. But through this technology after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, more than $43 million in donations were collected by relief organizations through donations by text message.Before leaving AT&T she held the title of Senior Vice President of Applications and Services Infrastructure. At AT&T she managed over 2,000 engineers and computer scientists responsible for over 500 programs impacting AT&T\u2019s enterprise and consumer wireline and mobility services. Her responsibilities ranged from product realization and service planning to development and testing.Croak joined Google in 2014, as a Vice President in the engineering group. At Google, she is responsible for expanding what the Internet is capable of doing around the world and increasing access to the Internet in the developing World. She created a new center of expertise on Responsible AI within Google Research.

Basic control concepts including \"observability\", \"stability\", and \"optimality\" are introduced, and many of the most important theoretical results are presented and explained. In a book review in the Artificial Intelligence Journal, James Hendler wrote that the book serves as a 'Rosetta Stone' for translation between the fields of robotics and AI.",
        "Anytime Algorithms": "The term anytime algorithm was coined by Dean and Boddy in the late '80s. The focus of Dean and Boddy's work in this area has been on deliberation scheduling applied to time-dependent planning problems. Deliberation scheduling is the explicit allocation of resources to tasks (in most cases anytime algorithms) so as to maximize the total value of an agent's computation. Time-dependent planning problems are defined to be planning problems where the time available for responding to events varies from situation to situation. In addition to defining the basic concepts, Dean and Boddy provided theoretical analyses and applications in robotics and operations research \n.",
        "Markov Processes": "Dean played a leading role in the adoption of the framework of Markov decision processes (MDPs) as a foundational tool in artificial intelligence. In particular, he pioneered the use of AI representations and algorithms for || factoring || complex models and problems into weakly-interacting subparts to improve computational efficiency.  His work in state estimation emphasized temporal causal reasoning  and the integration with probabilistic graphical models \n. His work in control includes state-space partitioning \n, hierarchical methods \n, and model minimization \n. This line of work is clearly summarized by a highly influential paper jointly written with Craig Boutilier and Steve Hanks.",
        "AI Textbook": "Working with his collaborators, James Allen and Yiannis Aloimonos specializing in respectively computer vision and natural language processing, Dean wrote one of the first modern AI textbooks incorporating probability theory, machine learning and robotics, and placing traditional AI topics such as symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation using the predicate calculus within a broader context. The first and only edition published in December 1994 initially competed with the first edition of Russell and Norvig's Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach that came out in 1995, but was eclipsed by the second edition of the Russell and Norvig text released in 2003.",
        "Robotics": "As co-chair of the 1991 AAAI Conference Dean organized a press event featuring mobile robots carrying trays of canap\u00e9s and barely avoiding the participants. The coverage on the evening news was enthusiastically positive and in 1992, Dean and Peter Bonasso, with feedback from the robotics community, created the AAAI Robotics Competition featuring events aimed at showing off robots competing in events that involved performing tasks in the home, office, and disaster sites \n. The competition was still being held in 2010.",
        "Computational Neuroscience": "No information",
        "Stanford Course": "After starting as a research scientist at Google, Dean was appointed as a consulting professor at Stanford and began teaching a course with the title Computational Models of the Neocortex. During the next fifteen years he invited top neuroscientists from all over the world to give talks and advise students working on class projects. Several of the classes resulted in papers coauthored by students that led to research projects at Google \n.",
        "Neuromancer Project": "In an effort to create a team focusing on scalable computational neuroscience, Dean and his students at Stanford to produced a white paper entitled Technology Prospects and Investment Opportunities for Scalable Neuroscience  that served as the basis for building a team of software engineers and computational neuroscientists focusing on connectomics. Early on, Dean worked with Christof Koch the chief scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Neuroscience to develop a partnership, and hired Viren Jain from HHMI to serve as the technical lead for the project.\nDean and Jain expanded the team to more than ten software engineers and participated in the planning of the NIH Brain Initiative. As their computer vision and machine learning tools improved, the team sought out and developed additional partnerships with Gerry Rubin at HHMI Janelia Campus, Jeff Lichtman at Harvard, and Winfried Denk at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology. Each of these collaborations would lead to high-accuracy, dense reconstructions of neural tissue samples in different organisms, repeatedly surpassing the current state of the art in size and quality \n.  Viren Jain is currently the project manager and lead scientist for the ongoing effort at Google.  The resulting data on brain connectivity, including the 'hemibrain' connectome, a highly detailed map of neuronal connectivity in the fly brain\n and the 'H01' dataset, a 1.4 petabyte rendering of a small sample of human brain tissue, was publicly released.",
        "Google Brain": "Dean led some of the earliest investigations into the use of neural networks at Google, that directly led to the creation of the Google Brain project. He experimented with approaches for using hardware acceleration to overcome current performance limitations in building industrial-scale web services, and collaborated with Dean Gaudet on the Google Infrastructure and Platforms Team to make the case for introducing graphic processing units (GPU) in Google data centers. He worked closely with Vincent Vanhoucke, who led the perception research and speech recognition quality team, to demonstrate the value of GPUs for training and deploying deep neural network architectures in the cloud focusing on speech recognition for Google Search by Voice.",
        "Administrative and Professional Services": "No information",
        "University Administration": "Dean served as the Deputy Provost of Brown University from 2003 to 2005, as the chair of Brown's Computer Science Department from 1997 until 2002, and as the Acting Vice President for Computing and Information Services from 2001 until 2002. As Deputy Provost he helped develop and launch new multidisciplinary programs in genomics and the brain sciences as well as oversee substantial changes in the medical school and university libraries.",
        "Professional Leadership": "Dean was named a fellow of AAAI in 1994 and an ACM fellow in 2009. He has served on the Executive Council of AAAI and the Computing Research Association Board of Directors. He was a recipient of an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1989. He served as program co-chair for the 1991 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the program chair for the 1999 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence held in Stockholm.

She sued Google, her former employer, for pregnancy discrimination, which ended in an undisclosed settlement after two years of litigation. She has successfully lobbied for pregnancy anti-discrimination and labor rights laws in Washington State.",
        "Education": "Glasson earned a Master of Science in Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) from the University of Washington (UW) in 2011.",
        "Career": "Glasson started her career as a public policy analyst. During a project she was leading at that time, she was tasked with designing a promotional website, prompting her to enroll in graduate school to change careers. She said she realized she was enrolled in the wrong program halfway through earning a Master of Arts in Communication when she took a user experience design (UX) course, which led her to enroll in the HCDE graduate program at UW and transition into the field of UX.",
        "2010\u20132014": "In 2010, while in graduate school, Glasson worked as an intern at T-Mobile, where she was later promoted to a full-time employee. After receiving her Master's degree, Glasson worked at Salesforce.She later joined Udacity as their lead user experience researcher, where she said she hoped to help democratize education. While at Udacity, Glasson developed a course under the direction of then-vice president of product and design Irene Au, \"Intro to the Design of Everyday Things\", which was based on the first two chapters of Don Norman's book, The Design of Everyday Things, revised and expanded in 2013. The instructors of the asynchronous course were Glasson, Norman and design professor Kristian Simsarian. Glasson also implemented the reflective exercises.Glasson became a guest editor for UX Magazine in 2013.",
        "Google (2014\u20132019)": "Glasson joined Google in Mountain View, California in 2014 as a user researcher, and was promoted several times into management. She said she was a strong performer, twice receiving a \"superb\" rating through the company's performance cycles. In July 2016, while Glasson was on her first of two maternity leaves, she relocated to Seattle, Washington, to work out of Google's Kirkland and Seattle offices. She said her manager, who was influential in the company's research department, allowed her to work remotely for the first few weeks after her leave ended. She said that this was due to her being a top performer. She was eventually promoted to managing a team of six, with another promotion planned prior to her second pregnancy. She left the company in August 2019 following what she alleged to be retaliation for reporting and experiencing pregnancy discrimination.In early August 2019, Glasson posted a 2,300-word memo about her departure from Google on an internal message board, which went viral within the company and was reported upon outside of the company, gaining media attention. In the memo she described her nearly five years at Google, and how her treatment at the company changed drastically after she reported what she alleged to be inappropriate comments about one of her direct reports, a mother of two sets of twins, in the spring of 2018. She alleged that her manager tried to get Glasson to encourage the woman to leave her team, or the company altogether, and that after she reported the misconduct, instead of an investigation into the accused manager, her complaint was reported to the manager.Glasson said she hired an attorney who sent Google a demand letter which requested a lateral internal transfer, an investigation into retaliation, and prevention of further retaliation. While she was healing from her caesarean section on an extended maternity leave, she said she was presented instead with a \"walk-away agreement\", offering three-months' salary worth of severance in exchange for leaving Google, release of legal claims, and signing a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Glasson refused to sign it, and stayed at the company until she voluntarily left in August 2019, after she says she was given a poor performance review during her second maternity leave. She said the performance review came after a \"shallow\" investigation into some of her discrimination claims, which ultimately resulted in Google finding no policy violations. Google suggested she utilize the company's employee assistance program (EAP) for free therapy, which she did.Glasson said that as a manager at Google, she was instructed to encourage the use of EAP counseling to distressed employees. She said that, after her own experiences, she believes that human resources teams directing employees to mental health counselors is \"meant to stop you in your tracks and silence you\", and to communicate that \"you're the problem\".In February 2020, Glasson wrote a Medium article alleging that in 2014 she was sexually harassed in a team off-site in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, by a company leader. Another Google employee also made allegations of sexual abuse against the same leader in 2015. Glasson alleged that after a colleague intervened in the incident in Cabo and reported the leader's behavior to human resources, the human resources team met with her in what she described as an \"interrogation\", and asked questions like, \"How much did you have to drink that night?\" She said that to her knowledge, no action was taken against the leader.She has criticized Google for attempting to \"tarnish the reputation\" of people who speak out, instead of offering real support and fixing problems.Glasson has since spoken to the Alphabet Workers Union about her experiences. She warned her former colleagues, \"Being a whistleblower so often wreaks havoc on your mental and physical health,\" and discussed the need for affordable legal and mental health services.",
        "2020\u2013present": "After leaving Google, Glasson worked at Facebook. In October 2020, Facebook employees spoke out in response to COVID-19 pandemic policies they alleged unfairly benefited workers with children. In response, Glasson wrote a Medium article asking for childless employees to empathize with the struggles their parenting colleagues face, highlighting her own need to take emergency leave when her childcare provider was closed due to the pandemic. She said that implying that parental leave is some sort of vacation or unfair advantage \"subjects parents to unconscious bias in performance reviews and downplays the type of support and benefits parents so desperately need\".As of October 2021, she worked at Compass, Inc., a real estate startup.In 2021, Glasson contributed to The Tech Worker Handbook, a website of free resources for employees who may be interested in speaking out on issues at their employers.",
        "Legal proceedings with Google": "Glasson filed a complaint against Google with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for pregnancy discrimination on September 3, 2019. The Seattle EEOC office began a probe into Glasson's claims in February 2020. As of July 2020, the case was still under investigation.In the lawsuit, and her complaints, Glasson alleged that she was told by third parties that her manager was making derogatory comments about her, interfered with her projects, and started interviewing others to replace her. She also alleged that when she reported she was pregnant with her second child that her work environment worsened. She said she tried to move internally, but was convinced to stay on her team after she was misled into believing her manager was leaving. After receiving what she described as unfair and surprising negative feedback, she accepted a demotion on another team, where she alleged she was discouraged from supervisory duties prior to her maternity leave, as it would \"rock the boat\", and was excluded from manager meetings and off-sites.Glasson further alleged that after she was diagnosed with placenta praevia, her new manager was dismissive, citing an NPR segment she had heard \"debunk[ing] the benefits of bed rest\", and her own experience ignoring medically-advised bed rest and delivering \"the biggest presentations of [her] career\" the day before her own child was born. Glasson further alleged that her manager informed her that she should not expect to be a manager when she returned from her leave.Google condemned retaliatory behavior, both internally and externally. The company told the EEOC that they had \"accommodated each of Ms. Glasson's pregnancy-related requests\", and that there was \"no support for Ms. Glasson's contention that she suffered discrimination or retaliation as a result\". They further argued that Glasson was not given direct reports in her last role at the company because of insufficient headcount.Glasson sent another demand letter to Google requesting the company work with the Center for Parental Leave Leadership to train managers at the company on supporting new and expecting parents to prevent others from facing the same types of discrimination and retaliation that she alleges she  faced, and asking for payment for emotional damages and reimbursement for her legal expenses. Google declined the settlement offer.During her lawsuit, which was scheduled for trial in January 2022, Facebook and Compass were subpoenaed for Glasson's employee records, including payroll information, performance reviews, any complaints raised by Glasson against those employers, and any and all communications referencing Google. She also said that because she is suing for emotional damages, Google received all of the notes from the counseling she was provided by the company's EAP, including private information about her marriage and sex life. She referred to the process as \"intrusive\", and said there were \"very few limits to what a corporation like Google can ask in discovery\". She later reported that more than a year later, the therapist suggested they stop their sessions and she find another provider as soon as she filed the lawsuit. Kristi Lee, an associate professor at Seattle University, said this sounded like \"client abandonment\", a violation of a formal ethical code for counselors. The New York Times discovered that Lyra Health, the healthcare provider used by Google and Facebook as of February 2022, allowed the company to share information without the client's consent if it was \"required to do so by a court order or other legal requirement\". A bill introduced in Washington State Legislature in January 2022 would prohibit that in the future, if passed into law, and the incident and therapist were placed under investigation by the Washington State Department of Health (WSDOH) after Glasson filed a complaint.In October 2021, Glasson wrote a Medium article about her experiences as a whistleblower and with the lawsuit against Google, and said that she had already spent $56,000 on the lawsuit. She also started a GoFundMe campaign to help with the legal costs.Glasson and Google reached an undisclosed settlement in February 2022.",
        "Legislation": "No information",
        "Pregnancy discrimination": "In 2020, Glasson worked with Senator Karen Keiser in the hopes of extending the statute of limitations for reporting pregnancy discrimination. The law only allowed six months to report discrimination, which Keiser said \"doesn't make sense\" given that \"it takes nine months or more to have a baby\". Glasson testified before the Washington State Senate on January 16, 2020, for Senate Bill (SB) 6034. The bill passed in both the senate and in the house in March 2020, and was later signed into law, extending the time pregnant workers have to file a complaint to one year.",
        "Employee assistant program rights": "Glasson consulted with Senator Keiser on the incident with Lyra Health sharing her therapy information with Google during her lawsuit, and in November 2021, the senator sent a letter to the WSDOH regarding a \"potential conflict\" between employers and employees who utilize EAPs. Senator Keiser then introduced a bill, SB 5564, that aims to protect workers' rights, would make it an unlawful practice to take adverse action against workers based on their utilization of EAPs, and prohibit providers from sharing individually identifiable information about employees with their employers. The bill was signed into law in March 2022.",
        "Whistleblower protection": "In October 2021, Glasson said she was inspired by Ifeoma Ozoma's work on California State Legislature's 2021 Silenced No More Act, which made it illegal for companies to use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing employees from speaking about unlawful conduct such as discrimination and harassment. Glasson contacted Washington state lawmakers in hopes of having a similar law enacted. Senator Keiser and House Representative Liz Berry sponsored the legislation in thanks to outreach from Glasson and Cher Scarlett, a former Apple security engineer who has filed whistleblower complaints about Apple. Both Glasson and Scarlett testified before the Washington House of Representatives for House Bill 1795 on January 18, 2022.Glasson testified that she was \"intimidated\" by the NDA she had signed when she joined the company, and by the terminology \"Google confidential information\", leading her to question whether or not she could speak to attorneys and government agencies about her experiences. Google denied that its NDAs prohibit workers from speaking out about discrimination and harassment. Glasson said in regards to the legislation, \"because NDAs were involved, many [workers] can't take action. [This] legislation will provide paths and opportunities for people to share, for people to fight.\"The bill was passed into law on March 3, 2022, and is effective as of June 9, 2022, with retroactive coverage. Google committed to Silenced No More protections for all employees following passage of the Washington legislation.Glasson has also mentioned that her legislative advocacy has been enabled by her status as a tech worker, \"With tech workers, part of the reason that we\u2019re able to fight is that we are tech workers. There are some industries where your career would be completely annihilated if you were to speak out.\"",

He was a representative from Tennessee (1977\u20131985) and from 1985 to 1993 served as a senator from that state. He served as vice president during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001, defeating incumbents George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle in 1992, and Bob Dole and Jack Kemp in 1996. The 2000 presidential election was one of the closest presidential races in history. Gore and his running mate Joe Lieberman won the popular vote, but after a controversial election dispute over a Florida recount (settled by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled 5\u20134 in favor of Bush), he lost the election to Republican opponent George W. Bush in the Electoral College.\nAfter his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and environmental activist, whose work in climate change activism earned him (jointly with the IPCC) the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. Gore is the founder and current chair of The Climate Reality Project, the co-founder and chair of Generation Investment Management, the now-defunct Current TV network, a member of the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. and a senior adviser to Google. Gore is also a partner in the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, heading its climate change solutions group. He has served as a visiting professor at Middle Tennessee State University, Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Fisk University and the University of California, Los Angeles. He served on the Board of Directors of World Resources Institute.Gore has received a number of awards that include the Nobel Peace Prize (joint award with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007), a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album (2009) for his book An Inconvenient Truth, a Primetime Emmy Award for Current TV (2007), and a Webby Award (2005). Gore was also the subject of the Academy Award winning (2007) documentary An Inconvenient Truth in 2006, as well as its 2017 sequel An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. In 2007, he was named a runner-up for Time's 2007 Person of the Year.  In 2008, Gore won the Dan David Prize for Social Responsibility.",
        "Early life and education": "Gore was born on March 31, 1948, in Washington, D.C., the second of two children of Albert Gore Sr., a U.S. Representative who later served for 18 years as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee, and Pauline (LaFon) Gore, one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt University Law School. Gore is a descendant of Scots Irish immigrants who first settled in Virginia in the mid-17th-century and moved to Tennessee after the Revolutionary War. His older sister Nancy LaFon Gore died of lung cancer.During the school year he lived with his family in The Fairfax Hotel in the Embassy Row section in Washington D.C. During the summer months, he worked on the family farm in Carthage, Tennessee, where the Gores grew tobacco and hay and raised cattle.Gore attended St. Albans School, an independent college preparatory day and boarding school for boys in Washington, D.C. from 1956 to 1965, a prestigious feeder school for the Ivy League. He was the captain of the football team, threw discus for the track and field team and participated in basketball, art, and government. He graduated 25th in a class of 51, applied to one college, Harvard University, and was accepted.",
        "Harvard, the Vietnam War, journalism, and Vanderbilt (1965\u20131976)": "No information",
        "Harvard": "Gore enrolled in Harvard College in 1965; he initially planned to major in English and write novels but later decided to major in government. On his second day on campus, he began campaigning for the freshman student government council and was elected its president.Gore was an avid reader who fell in love with scientific and mathematical theories, but he did not do well in science classes and avoided taking math. During his first two years, his grades placed him in the lower one-fifth of his class. During his second year, he reportedly spent much of his time watching television, shooting pool and occasionally smoking marijuana. In his junior and senior years, he became more involved with his studies, earning As and Bs. In his senior year, he took a class with oceanographer and global warming theorist Roger Revelle, who sparked Gore's interest in global warming and other environmental issues. Gore earned an A on his thesis, \"The Impact of Television on the Conduct of the Presidency, 1947\u20131969\", and graduated with an A.B. cum laude in June 1969.\n\nGore was in college during the era of anti Vietnam War protests. He was against that war, but he disagreed with the tactics of the student protest movement. He thought that it was silly and juvenile to use a private university as a venue to vent anger at the war. He and his friends did not participate in Harvard demonstrations. John Tyson, a former roommate, recalled that \"We distrusted these movements a lot ... We were a pretty traditional bunch of guys, positive for civil rights and women's rights but formal, transformed by the social revolution to some extent but not buying into something we considered detrimental to our country.\" Gore helped his father write an anti war address to the Democratic National Convention of 1968 but stayed with his parents in their hotel room during the violent protests.",
        "Military service": "When Gore graduated in 1969, he immediately became eligible for the military draft. His father, a vocal anti Vietnam War critic, was facing re-election in 1970. Gore eventually decided that enlisting in the Army would be the best course between serving his country, his personal values and interests. Although nearly all of his Harvard classmates avoided the draft and service in Vietnam, Gore believed if he found a way around military service, he would be handing an issue to his father's Republican opponent. According to Gore's Senate biography, \"He appeared in uniform in his father's campaign commercials, one of which ended with his father advising: 'Son, always love your country'.\" Despite this, Gore Sr. lost the election to an opponent who vastly out-fundraised him. This opponent was later found by the Watergate commission to have accepted illegal money from Nixon's operatives.Gore has said that his other reason for enlisting was that he did not want someone with fewer options than he to go in his place. Actor Tommy Lee Jones, a former college housemate, recalled Gore saying that \"if he found a fancy way of not going, someone else would have to go in his place\". His Harvard advisor, Richard Neustadt, also stated that Gore decided, \"that he would have to go as an enlisted man because, he said, 'In Tennessee, that's what most people have to do.' \" In addition, Michael Roche, Gore's editor for The Castle Courier, stated that \"anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on his butt and he didn't.\"After enlisting in August 1969, Gore returned to the anti war Harvard campus in his military uniform to say goodbye to his adviser and was \"jeered\" at by students. He later said he was astonished by the \"emotional field of negativity and disapproval and piercing glances that ... certainly felt like real hatred\".Gore had basic training at Fort Dix from August to October, and then was assigned to be a journalist at Fort Rucker, Alabama. In April 1970, he was named Rucker's \"Soldier of the Month\".His orders to be sent to Vietnam were \"held up\" for some time and the Gore family suspected that this was due to a fear by the Nixon administration that if something happened to him, his father would gain sympathy votes. He was finally shipped to Vietnam on January 2, 1971, after his father had lost his seat in the Senate during the 1970 Senate election, becoming one \"of only about a dozen of the 1,115 Harvard graduates in the Class of '69 who went to Vietnam\". Gore was stationed with the 20th Engineer Brigade in Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a and was a journalist with The Castle Courier. He received an honorable discharge from the Army in May 1971.Of his time in the Army, Gore later stated, \"I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform.\" He also later stated that his experience in Vietnam\n\ndidn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did not take into account the fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.",
        "Vanderbilt and journalism": "Gore was \"dispirited\" after his return from Vietnam. NashvillePost.com noted that, \"his father's defeat made service in a conflict he deeply opposed even more abhorrent to Gore. His experiences in the war zone don't seem to have been deeply traumatic in themselves; although the engineers were sometimes fired upon, Gore has said he didn't see full-scale combat. Still, he felt that his participation in the war was wrong.\"Although his parents wanted him to go to law school, Gore first attended Vanderbilt University Divinity School (1971\u201372) on a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship for people planning secular careers. He later said he went there in order to explore \"spiritual issues\", and that \"he had hoped to make sense of the social injustices that seemed to challenge his religious beliefs\".In 1971, Gore also began to work the night shift for The Tennessean as an investigative reporter. His investigations of corruption among members of Nashville's Metro Council resulted in the arrest and prosecution of two councilmen for separate offenses.In 1974, he took a leave of absence from The Tennessean to attend Vanderbilt University Law School. His decision to become an attorney was a partial result of his time as a journalist, as he realized that, while he could expose corruption, he could not change it. Gore did not complete law school, deciding abruptly, in 1976, to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives when he found out that his father's former seat in the House was about to be vacated.",
        "Congress (1977\u20131993)": "Gore began serving in the U.S. Congress at the age of 28 and stayed there for the next 16 years, serving in both the House (1977\u20131985) and the Senate (1985\u20131993). Gore spent many weekends in Tennessee, working with his constituents.",
        "House and Senate": "At the end of February 1976, U.S. Representative Joe L. Evins unexpectedly announced his retirement from Congress, making Tennessee's 4th congressional district seat, to which he had succeeded Albert Gore Sr. in 1953 open. Within hours after  The Tennessean  publisher John Seigenthaler Sr. called him to tell him the announcement was forthcoming, Gore decided to quit law school and run for the House of Representatives:\n\nGore's abrupt decision to run for the open seat surprised even himself; he later said that \"I didn't realize myself I had been pulled back so much to it.\" The news came as a \"bombshell\" to his wife. Tipper Gore held a job in The Tennessean's photo lab and was working on a master's degree in psychology, but she joined in her husband's campaign (with assurance that she could get her job at The Tennessean back if he lost). By contrast, Gore asked his father to stay out of his campaign: \"I must become my own man,\" he explained. \"I must not be your candidate.\"\nGore won the 1976 Democratic primary for the district with \"32 percent of the vote, three percentage points more than his nearest rival\", and was opposed only by an independent candidate in the election, recording 94 percent of the overall vote. He went on to win the next three elections, in 1978, 1980 and 1982, where \"he was unopposed twice and won 79 percent of the vote the other time\". In 1984, Gore successfully ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate, which had been vacated by Republican Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker. He was \"unopposed in the Democratic Senatorial primary and won the general election going away\", despite the fact that Republican President Ronald Reagan swept Tennessee in his reelection campaign the same year. Gore defeated Republican senatorial nominee Victor Ashe, subsequently the mayor of Knoxville, and the Republican-turned-Independent, Ed McAteer, founder of the Christian right Religious Roundtable organization that had worked to elect Reagan as president in 1980.\n\nDuring his time in Congress, Gore was considered a \"moderate\" once referring to himself as a \"raging moderate\" opposing federal funding of abortion, voting in favor of a bill which supported a moment of silence in schools, and voting against a ban on interstate sales of guns. In 1981, Gore was quoted as saying with regard to homosexuality, \"I think it is wrong\", and \"I don't pretend to understand it, but it is not just another normal optional life style.\" In his 1984 Senate race, Gore said when discussing homosexuality, \"I do not believe it is simply an acceptable alternative that society should affirm.\" He also said that he would not take campaign funds from gay rights groups. Although he maintained a position against homosexuality and gay marriage in the 1980s, Gore said in 2008 that he thinks \"gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women...to join together in marriage.\"  His position as a moderate (and on policies related to that label) shifted later in life after he became Vice President and ran for president in 2000.During his tenure in the House, Gore voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday. While Gore initially did not vote on the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 in January 1988, he voted to override President Reagan's veto the following March. Gore voted against the nomination of William Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the United States, as well as the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nDuring his time in the House, Gore sat on the Energy and Commerce and the Science and Technology committees, chairing the Science Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations for four years. He also sat on the House Intelligence Committee and, in 1982, introduced the Gore Plan for arms control, to \"reduce chances of a nuclear first strike by cutting multiple warheads and deploying single-warhead mobile launchers\". While in the Senate, he sat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the Rules and Administration, and the Armed Services Committees. In 1991, Gore was one of ten Democrats who supported the Gulf War.Gore was considered one of the Atari Democrats, given this name due to their \"passion for technological issues, from biomedical research and genetic engineering to the environmental impact of the \"greenhouse effect\". On March 19, 1979, he had become the first member of Congress to appear on C-SPAN. During this time, Gore co-chaired the Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future with Newt Gingrich. In addition, he has been described as having been a \"genuine nerd, with a geek reputation running back to his days as a futurist Atari Democrat in the House. Before computers were comprehensible, let alone sexy, the poker-faced Gore struggled to explain artificial intelligence and fiber-optic networks to sleepy colleagues.\" Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn noted that,\n\nas far back as the 1970s, Congressman Gore promoted the idea of high-speed telecommunications as an engine for both economic growth and the improvement of our educational system. He was the first elected official to grasp the potential of computer communications to have a broader impact than just improving the conduct of science and scholarship ... the Internet, as we know it today, was not deployed until 1983. When the Internet was still in the early stages of its deployment, Congressman Gore provided intellectual leadership by helping create the vision of the potential benefits of high speed computing and communication.\nGore introduced the Supercomputer Network Study Act of 1986. He also sponsored hearings on how advanced technologies might be put to use in areas like coordinating the response of government agencies to natural disasters and other crises.As a Senator, Gore began to craft the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 (commonly referred to as \"The Gore Bill\") after hearing the 1988 report Toward a National Research Network submitted to Congress by a group chaired by UCLA professor of computer science, Leonard Kleinrock, one of the central creators of the ARPANET (the ARPANET, first deployed by Kleinrock and others in 1969, is the predecessor of the Internet). The bill was passed on December 9, 1991, and led to the National Information Infrastructure (NII) which Gore referred to as the \"information superhighway\".After joining the House of Representatives, Gore held the \"first congressional hearings on the climate change, and co-sponsor[ed] hearings on toxic waste and global warming\". He continued to speak on the topic throughout the 1980s. In 1990, Senator Gore presided over a three-day conference with legislators from over 42 countries which sought to create a Global Marshall Plan, \"under which industrial nations would help less developed countries grow economically while still protecting the environment\".",
        "Son's 1989 accident and first book": "On April 3, 1989, Al, Tipper and their six-year-old son Albert were leaving a baseball game. Albert ran across the street to see his friend and was hit by a car. He was thrown 30 feet (9 m) and then traveled along the pavement for another 20 feet (6 m). Gore later recalled: \"I ran to his side and held him and called his name, but he was motionless, limp and still, without breath or pulse.... His eyes were open with the nothingness stare of death, and we prayed, the two of us, there in the gutter, with only my voice.\" Albert was tended to by two nurses who happened to be present during the accident. The Gores spent the next month in the hospital with Albert. Gore also commented: \"Our lives were consumed with the struggle to restore his body and spirit.\" This event was \"a trauma so shattering that [Gore] views it as a moment of personal rebirth\", a \"key moment in his life\" which \"changed everything\".In August 1991, Gore announced that his son's accident was a factor in his decision not to run for president in 1992. Gore stated: \"I would like to be President.... But I am also a father, and I feel deeply about my responsibility to my children.... I didn't feel right about tearing myself away from my family to the extent that is necessary in a Presidential campaign.\" During this time, Gore wrote Earth in the Balance, a text that became the first book written by a sitting U.S. Senator to make The New York Times Best Seller list since John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage.",
        "First presidential run (1988)": "In 1988, Gore sought the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States. Gore carried seven states in the primaries, finishing third overall in a field that included Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, then Senator, future Vice President and current President Joe Biden, Gary Hart, Congressman Dick Gephardt, Paul Simon and Jesse Jackson. Dukakis eventually won the Democratic nomination and went on to lose in a landslide to George H. W. Bush in the general election.\nAlthough Gore initially denied that he intended to run, his candidacy was the subject of speculation: \"National analysts make Sen. Gore a long-shot for the Presidential nomination, but many believe he could provide a natural complement for any of the other candidates: a young, attractive, moderate Vice Presidential nominee from the South. He currently denies any interest, but he carefully does not reject the idea out of hand.\" At the time, he was 39 years old, making him the \"youngest serious Presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy\".CNN noted that, \"in 1988, for the first time, 12 southern states would hold their primaries on the same day, dubbed \"Super Tuesday\". Gore thought he would be the only serious Southern contender; he had not counted on Jesse Jackson.\" Jackson defeated Gore in the South Carolina primary, winning, \"more than half the total vote, three times that of his closest rival here, Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee\". Gore next placed great hope on Super Tuesday where they split the Southern vote: Jackson winning Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia; Gore winning Arkansas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Nevada, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. Gore was later endorsed by New York City Mayor Ed Koch who made statements in favor of Israel and against Jackson. These statements cast Gore in a negative light, leading voters away from Gore who received only 10% of the vote in the New York primary. Gore then dropped out of the race. The New York Times said that Gore also lost support due to his attacks against Jackson, Dukakis, and others.Gore was eventually able to mend fences with Jackson, who supported the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1992 and 1996, and campaigned for the Gore-Lieberman ticket during the 2000 presidential election. Gore's policies changed substantially in 2000, reflecting his eight years as vice president.",
        "1992 presidential election": "Gore was initially hesitant to be Bill Clinton's running mate for the 1992 United States presidential election, but after clashing with the George H. W. Bush administration over global warming issues, he decided to accept the offer. Clinton stated that he chose Gore due to his foreign policy experience, work with the environment, and commitment to his family.Clinton's choice was criticized as unconventional because rather than picking a running mate who would diversify the ticket, Clinton chose a fellow Southerner who shared his political ideologies and who was nearly the same age as Clinton. The Washington Bureau Chief for The Baltimore Sun, Paul West, later suggested that, \"Al Gore revolutionized the way Vice Presidents are made. When he joined Bill Clinton's ticket, it violated the old rules. Regional diversity? Not with two Southerners from neighboring states. Ideological balance? A couple of left-of-center moderates. ... And yet, Gore has come to be regarded by strategists in both parties as the best vice presidential pick in at least 20 years.\"Clinton and Gore accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention on July 17, 1992. Known as the Baby Boomer Ticket and the Fortysomething Team, The New York Times noted that if elected, Clinton and Gore, at ages 45 and 44 respectively, would be the \"youngest team to make it to the White House in the country's history\".. Gore called the ticket \"a new generation of leadership\".The ticket increased in popularity after the candidates traveled with their wives, Hillary and Tipper, on a \"six-day, 1,000-mile bus ride, from New York to St. Louis\". Gore also debated the other vice presidential candidates, Dan Quayle, and James Stockdale. The Clinton-Gore ticket beat the Bush-Quayle ticket, 43%\u201338%.",
        "Vice presidency (1993\u20132001)": "Al Gore served as vice president during the Clinton administration.  Clinton and Gore were inaugurated on January 20, 1993. At the beginning of the first term, they developed a \"two-page agreement outlining their relationship\". Clinton committed himself to regular lunch meetings; he recognized Gore as a principal adviser on nominations and appointed some of Gore's chief advisers to key White House staff positions. Clinton involved Gore in decision-making to an unprecedented degree for a vice president. Through their weekly lunches and daily conversations, Gore became the president's \"indisputable chief adviser\".However, Gore had to compete with First Lady Hillary for President Clinton's influence, starting when she was appointed to the health-care task force without Gore's consultation. Vanity Fair wrote that President Clinton's \"failure to confide in his vice president was a telling sign of the real pecking order\", and reported \"it was an open secret that some of Hillary's advisers...nurtured dreams that Hillary, not Gore, would follow Bill in the presidency\".Gore had a particular interest in reducing \"waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government and advocated trimming the size of the bureaucracy and the number of regulations\". During the Clinton Administration, the U.S. economy expanded, according to David Greenberg (professor of history and media studies at Rutgers University) who said that \"by the end of the Clinton presidency, the numbers were uniformly impressive. Besides the record-high surpluses and the record-low poverty rates, the economy could boast the longest economic expansion in history; the lowest unemployment since the early 1970s; and the lowest poverty rates for single mothers, black Americans, and the aged.\"According to Leslie Budd, author of E-economy: Rhetoric or Business Reality, this economic success was due, in part, to Gore's continued role as an Atari Democrat, promoting the development of information technology, which led to the dot-com boom (c.\u20091995\u20132001). Clinton and Gore entered office planning to finance research that would \"flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry\". Their overall aim was to fund the development of, \"robotics, smart roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic-levitation trains, fiber-optic communications and national computer networks. Also earmarked [were] a raft of basic technologies like digital imaging and data storage.\" Critics claimed that the initiatives would \"backfire, bloating Congressional pork and creating whole new categories of Federal waste\".During the election and his term as vice president, Gore popularized the term Information Superhighway, which became synonymous with the Internet, and he was involved in the creation of the National Information Infrastructure. Gore first discussed his plans to emphasize information technology at UCLA on January 11, 1994, in a speech at The Superhighway Summit. On March 29, 1994, Gore made the inaugural keynote to a Georgetown University symposium on governmental reform with a lecture entitled, \"The new job of the federal executive\". Gore spoke on how technology was changing the nature of government, public administration, and management in general, noting that while in the past deep hierarchical structures were necessary to manage large organizations, technology was offering more accurate and streamlined access to information, thus facilitating flatter management structures. He was involved in a number of projects including NetDay '96 and 24 Hours in Cyberspace. The Clinton\u2013Gore administration also launched the first official White House website in 1994 and subsequent versions through 2000. During 1993 and early 1994, Gore was tapped by the administration to advocate for the adoption of the Clipper Chip, a technology developed by the National Security Agency designed to provide for law enforcement access to encrypted communications. After political and technical objections, the initiative was essentially dropped.\n\nGore was also involved in environmental initiatives. He launched the GLOBE program on Earth Day '94, an education and science activity that, according to Forbes magazine, \"made extensive use of the Internet to increase student awareness of their environment\". In 1998, Gore began promoting a NASA satellite (Deep Space Climate Observatory) that would provide a constant view of the Earth, marking the first time such an image would have been made since The Blue Marble photo from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. During this time, he also became associated with Digital Earth.Gore negotiated and strongly supported the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gasses, but said upon his return that the administration would not submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification until it was amended to include \"meaningful participation by key developing nations\", The Senate had previously passed unanimously (95\u20130) the Byrd\u2013Hagel Resolution (S. Res. 98), which declared opposition to any greenhouse gas treaty which would limit US emissions without similar limits on third-world countries such as China. The Clinton administration left office three years later without having submitted the treaty for ratification.\n\nIn 1996, Gore became involved in a \"Chinagate\" campaign finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, \"I did not know that it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake.\" A U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the fund-raising activities had uncovered evidence that Chinese agents sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC. FBI agents were denied the opportunity to ask President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore questions during Justice Department interviews in 1997 and 1998 and were only allowed to take notes. In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, \"all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised there was nothing wrong with that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law.\" The phrase \"no controlling legal authority\" was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: \"Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption.\" Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.During the 1990s, Gore spoke out on a number of issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice attempted to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.Soon afterward, Gore also had to contend with the Lewinsky scandal, which involved an affair between President Clinton and a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Gore initially defended Clinton, whom he believed to be innocent, stating, \"He is the president of the country! He is my friend ... I want to ask you now, every single one of you, to join me in supporting him.\" After Clinton was impeached, Gore continued to defend him stating, \"I've defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now ... to do everything I can to help him be the best president possible.\"",
        "Second presidential run (2000)": "There was talk of a potential run in the 2000 presidential race by Gore as early as January 1998. Gore discussed the possibility of running during a March 9, 1999, interview with CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer. In response to Wolf Blitzer's question: \"Why should Democrats, looking at the Democratic nomination process, support you instead of Bill Bradley\", Gore responded:\n\nI'll be offering my vision when my campaign begins. And it will be comprehensive and sweeping. And I hope that it will be compelling enough to draw people toward it. I feel that it will be. But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people. I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.\n\nFormer UCLA professor of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News led to the creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have \"invented the Internet\", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that \"we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet.\" Cerf would later state: \"Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit.\" In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: \"In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is\u2014and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got [to Congress], we were both part of a \"futures group\"\u2014the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen.\" Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: \"I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley ... Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to\u2014I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day.\"Gore himself would later poke fun at the controversy. In 2000, while on the Late Show with David Letterman he read Letterman's Top 10 List (which for this show was called, \"Top Ten Rejected Gore \u2013 Lieberman Campaign Slogans\") to the audience. Number nine on the list was: \"Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!\" In 2005 when Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award \"for three decades of contributions to the Internet\" at the Webby Awards he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): \"Please don't recount this vote.\" He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to joke: \"We all invented the Internet.\" Gore, who was then asked to add a few more words to his speech, stated: \"It is time to reinvent the Internet for all of us to make it more robust and much more accessible and use it to reinvigorate our democracy.\"During a speech that he gave on June 16, 1999, in Carthage, Tennessee, Gore formally announced his candidacy for president. His major theme was the need to strengthen the American family. He was introduced by his eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff. In making the speech, Gore also distanced himself from Bill Clinton, who he stated had lied to him. Gore was \"briefly interrupted\" by AIDS protesters claiming Gore was working with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent access to generic medicines for poor nations and chanting \"Gore's greed kills.\" Additional speeches were also interrupted by the protesters. Gore responded, \"I love this country. I love the First Amendment ... Let me say in response to those who may have chosen an inappropriate way to make their point, that actually the crisis of AIDS in Africa is one that should command the attention of people in the United States and around the world.\" Gore also issued a statement saying that he supported efforts to lower the cost of the AIDS drugs, provided that they \"are done in a way consistent with international agreements\".While Bill Clinton's job-approval ratings were around 60%, an April 1999 study by the Pew Research Center for the People found that respondents suffered from \"Clinton fatigue\" where they were \"tired of all the problems associated with the Clinton administration\" including the Lewinsky scandal and impeachment. Texas Governor and likely Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush was leading Gore 54% to 41% in polls during that time. Gore's advisers believed that the \"Lewinsky scandal and Bill's past womanizing...alienated independent voters\u2014especially the soccer moms, who stood for traditional values\". Consequently, Gore's presidential campaign \"veered too far in differentiating himself from Bill and his record and had difficulty taking advantage of the Clinton administration's legitimate successes\". In addition, Hillary's candidacy for the open Senate seat in New York exacerbated the \"three-way tensions evident in the White House since 1993\", as \"not only was Hillary unavailable as a campaigner, she was poaching top Democratic fund-raisers and donors who would normally concentrate on the vice president\". In one instance \"Hillary insisted on being invited [to a Los Angeles fundraiser for the vice president]\u2014over the objections of the event's organizers\", where the First Lady \"shocked the vice president's supporters by soliciting donations for herself in front of Tipper\".Gore faced an early challenge by former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley. Bradley was the only candidate to oppose Gore and was considered a \"fresh face\" for the White House. Gore challenged Bradley to a series of debates which took the form of \"town hall\" meetings. Gore went on the offensive during these debates leading to a drop in the polls for Bradley. In the Iowa caucus the unions pledged their support to Gore, despite Bradley spending heavily in that state, and Bradley was much embarrassed by his two to one defeat there. Gore went on to capture the New Hampshire primary 53-47%, which had been a must-win state for Bradley. Gore then swept all of the primaries on Super Tuesday while Bradley finished a distant second in each state. On March 9, 2000, after failing to win any of the first 20 primaries and caucuses in the election process, Bradley withdrew his campaign and endorsed Gore. Gore eventually went on to win every primary and caucus and, in March 2000 even won the first primary election ever held over the Internet, the Arizona Presidential Primary. By then, he secured the Democratic nomination.On August 13, 2000, Gore announced that he had selected Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became \"the first person of the Jewish faith to run for the nation's second-highest office\". Many pundits saw Gore's choice of Lieberman as further distancing him from the scandals of the Clinton White House. Gore's daughter, Karenna, together with her father's former Harvard roommate Tommy Lee Jones, officially nominated Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. Gore accepted his party's nomination and spoke about the major themes of his campaign, stating in particular his plan to extend Medicare to pay for prescription drugs and to work for a sensible universal health-care system. Soon after the convention, Gore hit the campaign trail with running mate Joe Lieberman. Gore and Bush were deadlocked in the polls. They participated in three televised debates. While both sides claimed victory after each, Gore was critiqued as either too stiff, too reticent, or too aggressive in contrast to Bush.",
        "Recount": "On election night, news networks first called Florida for Gore, later retracted the projection, and then called Florida for Bush, before finally retracting that projection as well. Florida's Republican Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, eventually certified Florida's vote count. This led to the Florida election recount, a move to further examine the Florida results.The Florida recount was stopped a few weeks later by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the ruling, Bush v. Gore, the Justices held that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7\u20132 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5\u20134 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 537 vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led to Gore winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes to Bush's 271 (one District of Columbia elector abstained). On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the election. Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but in his concession speech stated that, \"for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.\"",
        "Post-vice presidency (2001\u2013present)": "Bill Clinton and Gore had maintained an informal public distance for eight years, but they reunited for the media in August 2009.  Clinton had arranged for the release of two female journalists who were being held hostage in North Korea. The women were employees of Gore's Current TV. In May 2018, he was included as a member of the Indian Government committee to coordinate year long celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary from October 2, 2019.",
        "Criticism of Bush": "Beginning in 2002, Gore began to publicly criticize the Bush administration. In a September 23 speech that he gave before the Commonwealth Club of California, Gore criticized Bush and Congress for the rush to war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq. He compared this decision to the Persian Gulf War (which Gore had voted for) stating, \"Back in 1991, I was one of a handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War ... But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002. The circumstances are really completely different [...] in 1991, Iraq had crossed an international border, invaded a neighboring sovereign nation and annexed its territory. Now by contrast in 2002, there has been no such invasion.\" In a speech given in 2004, during the presidential election, Gore accused George W. Bush of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The next year, Gore gave a speech which covered many topics, including what he called \"religious zealots\" who claim special knowledge of God's will in American politics. Gore stated: \"They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith.\" After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Gore chartered two planes to evacuate 270 people from New Orleans and criticized the Bush administration's response to the hurricane. In 2006, Gore criticized Bush's use of domestic wiretaps without a warrant. One month later, in a speech given at the Jeddah Economic Forum, Gore criticized the treatment of Arabs in the U.S. after 9/11 stating, \"Unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it's wrong ... I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country.\" Gore's 2007 book, The Assault on Reason, is an analysis of what Gore refers to as the \"emptying out of the marketplace of ideas\" in civic discourse during the Bush administration. He attributes this phenomenon to the influence of television and argues that it endangers American democracy. By contrast, Gore argues, the Internet can revitalize and ultimately \"redeem the integrity of representative democracy\". In 2008, Gore argued against the ban of same-sex marriage on his Current TV website, stating, \"I think that gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women to make contracts, have hospital visiting rights, and join together in marriage.\" In a 2009 interview with CNN, Gore commented on former Vice President Dick Cheney's criticism of the Obama administration. Referring to his own previous criticism of the Bush administrations, Gore stated: \"I waited two years after I left office to make statements that were critical, and then of the policy ... You know, you talk about somebody that shouldn't be talking about making the country less safe, invading a country that did not attack us and posed no serious threat to us at all.\"While Gore has criticized Bush for his Katrina response, he has not spoken publicly about his part in the evacuation of 270 patients on September 3 & 4, 2005, from Charity Hospital in New Orleans to Tennessee. On September 1, Gore was contacted by Charity Hospital's Neurosurgeon Dr. David Kline, who had operated on his son Albert, through Greg Simon of FasterCures. Kline informed Gore and Simon of the desperate conditions at the hospital and asked Gore and Simon to arrange relief. On Gore's personal financial commitment, two airlines each provided a plane with one flight later underwritten by Larry Flax. The flights were flown by volunteer airline crews and medically staffed by Gore's cousin, retired Col. Dar LaFon, and family physician Dr. Anderson Spickard and were accompanied by Gore and Albert III. Gore used his political influence to expedite landing rights in New Orleans.",
        "Presidential run speculation": "People were speculating that Gore would be a candidate for the 2004 presidential election (a bumper sticker, \"Re-elect Gore in 2004!\" was popular). On December 16, 2002, however, Gore announced that he would not run in 2004. While Gore seriously considered challenging Bush in 2004, the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent stratospheric rise in President Bush's popularity as a result of his response to these attacks were strong factors in Gore's December 2002 decision not to run again in 2004. Despite Gore taking himself out of the race, a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to draft him into running. The draft movement, however, failed to convince Gore to run.The prospect of a Gore candidacy arose again between 2006 and early 2008 in light of the upcoming 2008 presidential election. Although Gore frequently stated that he had \"no plans to run\", he did not reject the possibility of future involvement in politics which led to speculation that he might run. This was due in part to his increased popularity after the release of the 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. The director of the film, Davis Guggenheim, stated that after the release of the film, \"Everywhere I go with him, they treat him like a rock star.\" After An Inconvenient Truth was nominated for an Academy Award, Donna Brazile (Gore's campaign chairwoman from his 2000 campaign) speculated that Gore might announce a possible presidential candidacy during the Oscars. During the 79th Academy Awards ceremony, Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio shared the stage to speak about the \"greening\" of the ceremony itself. Gore began to give a speech that appeared to be leading up to an announcement that he would run for president. However, background music drowned him out and he was escorted offstage, implying that it was a rehearsed gag, which he later acknowledged. After An Inconvenient Truth won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, speculation increased about a possible presidential run. Gore's popularity was indicated in polls which showed that even without running, he was coming in second or third among possible Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards. Grassroots draft campaigns also developed with the hope that they could encourage Gore to run. Gore, however, remained firm in his decision and declined to run for the presidency.Interest in having Gore run for the 2016 presidential election arose in 2014 and again in 2015, although he did not declare any intention to do so.",
        "Involvement in presidential campaigns": "After announcing he would not run in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Gore endorsed Vermont governor Howard Dean in December 2003, weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. He was criticized for this endorsement by eight Democratic contenders particularly since he did not endorse his former running mate Joe Lieberman (Gore preferred Dean over Lieberman because Lieberman supported the Iraq War and Gore did not). Dean's campaign soon became a target of attacks and eventually failed, with Gore's early endorsement being credited as a factor. In The New York Times, Dean stated: \"I actually do think the endorsement of Al Gore began the decline.\" The Times further noted that \"Dean instantly amplified his statement to indicate that the endorsement from Mr. Gore, a powerhouse of the establishment, so threatened the other Democratic candidates that they began the attacks on his candidacy that helped derail it.\" Dean's former campaign manager, Joe Trippi, also stated that after Gore's endorsement of Dean, \"alarm bells went off in every newsroom in the country, in every other campaign in the country\", indicating that if something did not change, Dean would be the nominee. Later, in March 2004, Gore endorsed John Kerry and gave Kerry $6 million in funds left over from his own unsuccessful 2000 bid. Gore also opened the 2004 Democratic National Convention.During the 2008 primaries, Gore remained neutral toward all of the candidates which led to speculation that he would come out of a brokered 2008 Democratic National Convention as a \"compromise candidate\" if the party decided it could not nominate one. Gore responded by stating that these events would not take place because a candidate would be nominated through the primary process. Senator Ted Kennedy had urged Gore to endorse Senator Barack Obama though Gore declined. When Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on June 3, 2008, speculation began that Gore might be tapped for the vice presidency. On June 16, 2008, one week after Hillary Clinton had suspended her campaign, Gore endorsed Obama in a speech given in Detroit, Michigan which renewed speculation of an Obama-Gore ticket. Gore stated, however, that he was not interested in being vice president again. On the timing and nature of Gore's endorsement, some argued that Gore waited because he did not want to repeat his calamitous early endorsement of Howard Dean during the 2004 presidential election. On the final night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, shortly before Obama delivered his acceptance address, Gore gave a speech offering his full support. Such support led to new speculation after Obama was elected president during the 2008 presidential election that Gore would be named a member of the Obama administration. This speculation was enhanced by a meeting held between Obama, Gore, and Joe Biden in Chicago on December 9, 2008. However, Democratic officials and Gore's spokeswoman stated that during the meeting the only subject under discussion was the climate crisis, and Gore would not be joining the Obama administration. On December 19, 2008, Gore described Obama's environmental administrative choices of Carol Browner, Steven Chu, and Lisa Jackson as \"an exceptional team to lead the fight against the climate crisis\".Gore repeated his neutrality eight years later during the Democratic presidential primaries of 2016 until endorsing Hillary Clinton on July 25, 2016, the first day of that year's Democratic National Convention. Gore appeared with her at a rally on Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus on October 11, 2016.",
        "Environmentalism": "Gore has been involved with environmental issues since 1976 when as a freshman congressman, he held the \"first congressional hearings on the climate change, and co-sponsor[ed] hearings on toxic waste and global warming\". He continued to speak on the topic throughout the 1980s, and is still prevalent in the environmental community. He was known as one of the Atari Democrats, later called the \"Democrats' Greens, politicians who see issues like clean air, clean water and global warming as the key to future victories for their party\".In 1990, Senator Gore presided over a three-day conference with legislators from over 42 countries which sought to create a Global Marshall Plan, \"under which industrial nations would help less developed countries grow economically while still protecting the environment\". In the late 1990s, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the Kyoto Protocol, which called for the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. He was opposed by the Senate, which passed unanimously (95\u20130) the Byrd\u2013Hagel Resolution (S. Res. 98), which stated the sense of the Senate was that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and timetables for developing as well as industrialized nations or \"would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States\".In 2004, Gore co-launched Generation Investment Management, a company for which he serves as chair. A few years later, Gore would also found the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization which eventually founded the We Campaign. Gore would also become a partner in the venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, heading that firm's climate change solutions group. He also helped to organize the Live Earth benefit concerts. In 2010, he attended WE Day (Vancouver, Canada), a WE Charity event.\n\nIn 2013, Gore became a vegan. He had earlier admitted that \"it's absolutely correct that the growing meat intensity of diets across the world is one of the issues connected to this global crisis \u2013 not only because of the [carbon dioxide] involved, but also because of the water consumed in the process\" and some speculate that his adoption of the new diet is related to his environmentalist stance. In a 2014 interview, Gore said \"Over a year ago I changed my diet to a vegan diet, really just to experiment to see what it was like. ... I felt better, so I've continued with it and I'm likely to continue it for the rest of my life.\"Gore's An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, a sequel to his 2006 film, An Inconvenient Truth, premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. The film documents his continuing efforts to battle climate change.A \"Climate and Health Summit\" which was originally going to be held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was cancelled without warning in late January 2017. A few days later, Gore revived the summit, which was held by the Climate Reality Project without the support of the CDC. In 2020 he helped to launch Climate TRACE to independently monitor global greenhouse gas emissions.In November 2021, Gore spoke at the early stages of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland. He later criticised the Morrison Government for failing to increase Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target.",
        "Criticism": "In the late 1980s and 1990s, Gore was criticized for his involvement in asking the EPA for less strict pollution controls for the Pigeon River, which had long been polluted by a paper mill in Canton, North Carolina.A number of people and organizations, including Marsha Blackburn, a current U.S. Senator and former Congresswoman from Tennessee, and a conservative Washington, D.C. think tank, have claimed that Gore has a conflict of interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies in which he has a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy efficient.Data in An Inconvenient Truth have been questioned. In a 2007 court case, a British judge said that while he had \"no doubt ...the film was broadly accurate\" and its \"four main scientific hypotheses ...are supported by a vast quantity of research\", he upheld nine of a \"long schedule\" of alleged errors presented to the court. He ruled that the film could be shown to schoolchildren in the UK if guidance notes given to teachers were amended to balance out the film's one-sided political views. Gore's spokesperson responded in 2007 that the court had upheld the film's fundamental thesis and its use as an educational tool. In 2009, Gore described the British court ruling as being \"in my favor\".Gore was also criticized when in 2012 he sold his television channel Current TV for around $100 million to Al Jazeera, a media company funded by the government of Qatar, a nation largely dependent on income from the fossil fuel industry.",
        "Allegations of aggrandizement": "No information",
        "\"Inventing the internet\"": "Critics of Gore have jumped on a statement he made in a 1999 interview on CNN with Wolf Blitzer by misquoting him as claiming he was instrumental in \"inventing the internet\".  In reality, Gore stated: \"During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system. During a quarter century of public service, including most of it long before I came into my current job, I have worked to try to improve the quality of life in our country and in our world. And what I've seen during that experience is an emerging future that's very exciting, about which I'm very optimistic, and toward which I want to lead.\"It is easy to misinterpret the claim of \"creating\" with \"inventing\" the internet.  Gore has been characterized as having either misspoke, or failed to clarify his important part in the transition of the internet from a defense network to a public network.  Gore spent years promoting the internet and high-speed telecommunications as being important to the world as far back as the 1970s.  A spirited defense of Gore\u2019s statement penned by Internet pioneers Bob Kahn and Vinton Cerf (the latter often referred to as the \u201cfather of the Internet\u201d) in 2000 noted that \u201cAl Gore was the first political leader to recognize the importance of the Internet and to promote and support its development\u201d and that \u201cNo other elected official, to our knowledge, has made a greater contribution [to the Internet] over a longer period of time\u201d.",
        "\"Protagonists of Love Story\"": "In 1997, Gore was having a late-night conversation with two reporters aboard Air Force Two when he casually mentioned that he had either read or was told that he and Tipper's early pre-marital relationship in Boston while Gore was at Harvard was the basis for Oliver and Jenny Barrett, the protagonists of Erich Segal's novel Love Story and its film adaptation.  One of the reporters present, New York Times reporter Rick Berke, stated that Gore didn't offer it as a fact and that it was just second-hand info from a Nashville Tennessean article or reporter who had interviewed Segal. Berke decided not to mention it in his article since it was not offered as a fact by Gore. However, the other reporter present, Karen Tumulty (who was with Time and is with The Washington Post as of 2022) included the quote in her own article and presented it as though Gore claimed it as fact, which claim was picked up by numerous publications afterward as being another example of Gore bragging about an incident that was either a lie or misleading. Segal then went public to clarify that Gore was half of the basis for Oliver Barrett, which was the familial emotional baggage part, while the other half (athletic and poetic) was based on actor Tommy Lee Jones, and that he knew Tipper then, but that she was not a basis for the book and movie at all, nor was the Gores' relationship, and offered that the Tennessee reporter either misquoted him or exaggerated the story. Segal had also attended Harvard, but had done so mostly a decade or so earlier between 1954 to 1959, then later obtained his doctorate at Harvard in 1965.  Segal met both the Gores and Jones while on sabbatical at Harvard in 1968 just after his college years.",
        "Personal life": "Gore met Mary Elizabeth \"Tipper\" Aitcheson at his St. Albans senior prom in 1965. She was from the nearby St. Agnes School. Tipper followed Gore to Boston to attend college, and they married at the Washington National Cathedral on May 19, 1970.They have four children; Karenna Gore (b. 1973), Kristin Carlson Gore (b. 1977), Sarah LaFon Gore (b. 1979) and Albert Arnold Gore III (b. 1982).In June 2010 the Gores announced in an e-mail to friends that after \"long and careful consideration\" they had made a mutual decision to separate.  In May 2012, it was reported that Gore started dating Elizabeth Keadle of Rancho Santa Fe, California.He is Baptist, member of Georgetown Baptist Church in Washington, D.C..He is possibly related to the Albert \"Al\" N. Gore who ran in the 2012 Mississippi Senate election. In some interviews, the candidate described how he might be distantly related to the vice-president by saying the Gore family split into two factions in the 1800s, with one going to Tennessee (and later giving rise to the vice-president and his Tennessee Senator father), and the other going to Mississippi (giving rise to that state's Democratic Senate candidate). Despite the speculation, it has never officially been confirmed if the two are in fact distant relatives.",
        "Awards and honors": "Gore is the recipient of a number of awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize (together with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) in 2007, a Primetime Emmy Award for Current TV in 2007, a Webby Award in 2005, the Dan David Prize in 2008 and the Prince of Asturias Award in 2007 for International Cooperation. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2008. He also starred in the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2007 and wrote the book An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It, which won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2009.",

        "Introduction": "Tristan Harris () is an American technology ethicist. He is the executive director and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology.Early in his career, Harris worked as a design ethicist at Google. He received his baccalaureate degree from Stanford University, where he studied computer science.Harris has appeared in the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma. The film features Harris and other  former tech employees explaining how the design of social media platforms nurtures addiction to maximize profit and manipulates people's views, emotions, and behavior. The film also examines social media's effect on mental health, particularly of adolescents.",
        "Early life and education": "Harris was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He studied computer science at Stanford University while interning at Apple Inc. He then embarked on a master's degree at Stanford with a focus on Human\u2013Computer Interaction, where he took a class from B. J. Fogg, who runs the Persuasive Technology Lab, before dropping out. At Stanford, Harris was classmates with one of Instagram's founders, Kevin Systrom, and helped create a demo app with the other founder, Mike Krieger.",
        "Career": "In 2007, Harris launched a startup called Apture. Google acquired Apture in 2011, and Harris ended up working on Google Inbox.In February 2013, while working at Google, Harris authored a presentation titled \u201cA Call to Minimize Distraction & Respect Users\u2019 Attention\u201d, which he shared with coworkers. In that presentation, he suggested that Google, Apple and Facebook should \"feel an enormous responsibility\" to make sure humanity doesn't spend its days buried in a smartphone. The 141-slide deck was eventually viewed by tens of thousands of Google employees and sparked conversations about the company's responsibilities long after he left the company. Harris holds several patents from his previous work at Apple, Wikia, Apture, and Google.Harris left Google in December 2015 to co-found the 501(c)3 nonprofit organization Time Well Spent, later called the Center for Humane Technology. Through his work at CHT, Harris hoped to re-align technology with humanity's best interest. He asserted that human minds can be hijacked and the choices they make are not as free as they think they are.At CHT, Harris has advocated for understanding and minimizing the negative impacts of digital technologies. In 2017, he spoke on 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper about the addictive design of smartphone apps. At a 2019 presentation in San Francisco, he coined the phrase \"human downgrading\" to describe an interconnected system of mutually reinforcing harms\u2014addiction, distraction, isolation, polarization, fake news\u2014that weakens human capacity, in order to capture human attention.Harris and other CHT team members were interviewed for the film The Social Dilemma, distributed by Netflix. In it he says about the harms of social media, \"Never before in history have 50 designers made decisions that would have an impact on two billion people\" about the harms of social media.In 2021, Harris was named to the TIME 100 Next list.CHT offers an online course on how to build humane and ethical technology, called The Foundations of Humane Technology, which has received notable media coverage. In recent years, Harris has expanded his focus from the attention economy to close the gap between the accelerating pace of technology and risks/externalities it creates, compared to the capacity of culture and its institutions to respond and adequately guard against them. Harris and CHT call this \"The Wisdom Gap.\"The Atlantic stated in their November 2016 issue that \"Harris is the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience.\" Since then, he has been named on Time 100 Next Leaders Shaping 2021, Rolling Stone\u2019s 25 People Changing the Future, and Fortune\u2019s 25 Ideas that Will Change the Future. He is also the co-host of the podcast, Your Undivided Attention.",
        "Media and other activities": "At the TEDTalk 2017 conference, Harris exposed how a handful of tech companies are able to manipulate billions of people to generate billions of dollars in ad revenue.

        "Career and activism": "No information",
        "Google (2007-2019)": "Stapleton began working for Google in 2007, after briefly considering a role with Teach For America, working on the internal communications team at their Mountain View, California campus.During her communications work, Stapleton helped produce the company's weekly all-hands meeting, known as TGIF, hosted by founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. She was also responsible for writing the company's talking points in weekly emails to employees. At her final TGIF in Mountain View in 2012, Page called Stapleton on stage and presented her with a wooden plaque that dubbed her \"The Bard of Google\".Later, Stapleton joined YouTube's team as a marketing manager in New York City.On November 1, 2018, Stapleton, along with 20,000 Google workers across 50 cities, walked off the job in protest of Google's contracts with The Pentagon such as Project Maven, Project Dragonfly, and Project JEDI, and the company's handling of sexual harassment allegations, including a $90 million exit package for Andy Rubin, who allegedly coerced a junior employee into sexual contact. Rubin referred to the report as a \"wild exaggeration\", and denies any misconduct. The employees, led by Stapleton, Meredith Whittaker, a former Google Artificial Intelligence researcher, and five others also put together a list of demands for change, including addressing what they alleged was \"rampant\" sexism and racism, getting rid of mandatory arbitration, and better pay for contractors. According to Stapleton, the events themselves were not the catalyst of their strike, but rather the TGIF that followed the news of Rubin's resignation, which she said was \"dismissive\" and ignored the report about payouts to male executives accused of sexual misconduct, though CEO Sundar Pichai and Page both reportedly apologized. Pichai also said that 48 employees had been terminated after investigations into harassment over the previous two years, none of whom received an exit package. Stapleton said the meeting sparked her to start an email list for women at the company, which she said quickly grew to more than 1,500 members.In the days following the walkout, Google responded in support, Pichai saying, \"I take this responsibility very seriously and I\u2019m committed to making the changes we need to improve\", in a memo to employees. The memo also announced concession to some of the demands, including ending forced arbitration in cases of sexual assault and sexual harassment and overhaul the process for reporting sexual misconduct. Stapleton and the other leaders acknowledged the progress in a note posted on the Google Walkout Medium account, but criticized leadership saying they, \"troublingly erased [the demands] focused on racism, discrimination, and ... structural inequity\", and for ignoring the request to elevate the diversity officer to the board. When asked who should be leading addressing the remaining demands, Stapleton said, \"Larry and Sergey, where are they?\"In January 2019, Stapleton said she was demoted as part of a restructuring she said was vaguely communicated, losing half of her direct reports. She also said her work was reassigned to others and that her manager ignored her, and she was pushed to resign. When Stapleton attempted to press human resources about the changes to her role and her work being delegated to other people, she said that the company advised her to go on medical leave, even though she wasn't ill. Stapleton hired an attorney, prompting a re-investigation into the demotion, and said that it was \"walked back ... at least on paper.\"In April 2019, Stapleton and Whittaker alleged their managers had retaliated against them for their participation in organizing the walkout, a claim that Google denied. To Stapleton's allegations specifically, Google claimed that her allegations of retaliation was unsubstantiated because they had found that they gave her their team's Culture Award for her role in the walkout. Stapleton, Whittaker, and others who had led the Google Walkout promoted a social media campaign under the hashtag #NotOkGoogle to gather additional stories of alleged retaliation, and shared their experiences of alleged retaliation on Medium. They said company had a \"culture of retaliation\" that disproportionately affected marginalized and underrepresented groups. While the campaign gained fast momentum, Google announced they had created a new website for employees to report misconduct.On April 26, 2019, Stapleton and Whittaker held a \"Retaliation Town Hall\" that was livestreamed to Google offices. Attendees reported that Stapleton shared emails she said were sent from the executives to \"thousands\" of her coworkers disputing that she had been demoted. While Google has maintained that it \"does not tolerate retaliation\", employees who attended the town hall shared stories of their own alleged retaliation, and organized a sit-in protest on May 1, 2019 in response. Some employees took a \"sick day\" while staying at the office in honor of Stapleton's claim that she was urged to take medical leave when she said she was not sick. Later, additional employees with public resignations also alleged retaliation due to what they believed was their involvement in organizing.On May 31, 2019, while pregnant with her second child, Stapleton resigned from the company in exchange for severance. A note she shared internally was published by the Google Walkout Medium account the following week, which gained media attention. In the note, Stapleton described how her perspective of the company shifted over her tenure from pride and inspiration until 2017, when she returned from maternity leave with her first child and felt the company had \"lost its moral compass.\" She described her decision to quit saying, \u201cIf I stayed, I didn\u2019t just worry that there\u2019d be more public flogging, shunning, and stress, I expected it.\u201d Stapleton said she was physically escorted off of the premises by security, who also confiscated her company devices, she also said this was unconventional for departing workers. Stapleton later warned potential Big Tech candidates to be wary of buying into the idea of changing the world from the inside saying, \"...if you care about a company\u2019s values, ethics and contributions to society, you should take your talents elsewhere.\"In an essay for Elle in December 2019, Stapleton said that she became \"intimately familiar\" with how hostile Google's \"famously open culture\" was to outspoken workers, and that it was evidence of the lengths the company's leadership was willing to go to prevent staffers from holding the company accountable. She also pointed out the fa\u00e7ade of support around the walkout from Pichai and CFO Ruth Porat, who petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to limit protections for workers organizing via email a few days after the walkout.",

    "Miles Taylor (security expert)": {
        "Introduction": "Miles Taylor (born 1986/1987) is an American government official who served in the administrations of George W. Bush and Donald Trump. In the administration of the latter, he was an appointee who served in the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from 2017 to 2019, including as chief of staff of the DHS. He was first recruited into the department by former DHS Secretary and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, serving as his senior advisor.\nTaylor wrote The New York Times op-ed in 2018 under the pen-name \"Anonymous\" that was entitled, \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\" that drew widespread attention for its criticism of Trump. In September 2019, he left the administration and went to work for Google. In November 2019, again under the pen name \"Anonymous\" he published a book entitled, A Warning. In October 2020, he revealed that he was \"Anonymous\" while campaigning against Trump's reelection.In August 2020, Taylor produced an advertisement for Republican Voters Against Trump, denouncing Trump and endorsing Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election. He was the first former Trump administration official to endorse Biden. He later co-founded the Renew America Movement, alongside former Republican governors, members of Congress, and cabinet officials, with the objective to break Trump's hold on the Republican Party. In May 2022 he announced that he was leaving the Republican Party, and two months later, he co-founded the Forward Party with former New Jersey Governor Christie Todd Whitman, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, and former GOP Congressman David Jolly.",
        "Early life and education": "Taylor grew up in La Porte, Indiana, where he was an Indiana state debate champion, and one of the valedictorians of his class at La Porte High School in 2006. While in high school, he served as a page in the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. He received a bachelor of arts degree in international security studies from Indiana University Bloomington, which he attended as a Harry S. Truman Scholar and Herman B. Wells Scholar. As a senior, he received IU's inaugural Presidential Student Internship  and was a recipient of the Elvis J. Stahr Award awarded to the university's top few graduating seniors.Taylor received an MPhil in International Relations from New College, Oxford, which he attended as a 2012 Marshall Scholar.",
        "Career": "Taylor's decision to have a career in government was largely motivated by the September 11 attacks in 2001. He later said that he \"wanted to focus my entire professional life on making sure a day like that wouldn't happen again, and dedicating my career to, what I thought, was the mission of this country, and that's the advancement of human freedom.\"In 2007, while in college, Taylor interned in the office of the Secretary of Defense and the office of Vice President Dick Cheney. In 2008, he worked as the briefing book coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security for Secretary Michael Chertoff and Deputy Secretary Paul A. Schneider. In 2009, he served as a regional policy intern for the Defense Department.Taylor was a political appointee in the administration of George W. Bush. He was a staffer for the House Appropriations Committee and then the Committee on Homeland Security, where he served on Chairman Michael McCaul's staff. Taylor was McCaul's chief speechwriter and national security advisor on counterterrorism and foreign policy. He also served as the majority staff lead for the congressional Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel. In 2015, he was named a Penn Kemble Fellow by the National Endowment for Democracy.",
        "Department of Homeland Security": "Taylor joined the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in February 2017, when John Kelly, later White House Chief of Staff, was Secretary of Homeland Security. Taylor served as DHS deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to Kelly. He later served as chief of staff of DHS toward the end of the tenure of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and the beginning of Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan. Taylor described a version of the Trump administration's travel restrictions as \"tough\" but \"tailored\". He reportedly clashed with other officials to try to limit the number of countries affected by it. He was also involved in debates regarding Trump administration immigration policies. He later described the Trump administration family separation policy as a \"sickening display of bad judgment\". Taylor cited the \"train wreck\" policy as one of his reasons for quitting the Trump Administration in protest, calling it \"one of the most disheartening and disgusting things I've ever experienced in public service.\"",
        "\"Anonymous\"": "Taylor authored a September 2018 The New York Times op-ed entitled, \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\" under the name \"Anonymous\". He said that, in April 2019, he had personally witnessed President Trump offer Homeland Security staff federal pardons for any criminal prosecution arising from their actions in stopping illegal immigration to the United States, and it was at that point that Taylor decided to resign from the department. He left DHS in June 2019, and anonymously released a follow-up book entitled, A Warning (November 2019), which included an account of the instability inside the Trump White House and administration. USA Today called the book \"a scathing portrait of a president and administration in chaos,\" and The Washington Post wrote that the book had \"no modern historical parallel for a firsthand account of a sitting president written in book form by an anonymous author\". It reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list.Taylor initially denied being \"Anonymous\" in a number of interviews. After he acknowledged that he was \"Anonymous\", he said he owed a mea culpa to those journalists, but noted that, as \"Anonymous\", he always had said that he \"would ultimately come out under my own name\". In an online discussion after the release of A Warning, he had answered questions anonymously and said he would reveal his identity in the coming months before the 2020 election. He also pledged to donate the bulk of the proceeds from the book to nonprofit organizations such as the White House Correspondents' Association. Of his decision not to reveal his identity, Taylor said in October 2020:  \"Issuing my critiques without attribution forced the President to answer them directly on their merits or not at all, rather than creating distractions through petty insults and name-calling. I wanted the attention to be on the arguments themselves.\"",
        "Google": "In September 2019, Taylor was hired by Google as a government affairs and public policy manager with a title of head of national security policy engagement. He was later promoted to lead Google's advanced technology and security strategy. Around the same time, he also became a senior fellow at the Auburn University McCrary Center for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.",
        "Public opposition to the Trump administration": "In August 2020, Taylor took a leave of absence from Google to support Joe Biden's presidential campaign. He made an advertisement for Republican Voters Against Trump, denouncing Trump and endorsing Biden in the 2020 presidential election. That same month, Taylor also wrote an opinion piece for The Washington Post. Columnist Jennifer Rubin said the op-ed added \"detail to what we could have only surmised was the story behind chaotic policy rollouts\" and that the advertisement he released \"may be the most compelling of the 2020 election cycle\". The next day, Taylor appeared on multiple news and analysis shows saying that other former members of the Trump administration were considering speaking out similarly. On August 24, Taylor confirmed to NBC News that he was co-founding, with two other unnamed Republican officials, the Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform (REPAIR), a group that aimed to oppose reelection of Trump and to reform the Republican Party after the 2020 election.Journalist Judy Woodruff asked Taylor in a PBS NewsHour interview why he had spoken out when he did rather than immediately after leaving the administration. Taylor responded,\n\nIf I had come out and talked about Donald Trump a year ago, when I left the administration, he's a master of distraction. He would have buried it within a day, and it wouldn't have mattered to voters. But, right now, American voters are reviewing the president's resume...so, I think there's no more important time for me or other ex-Trump officials to come out and actually talk about what the experience was inside the administration and what kind of man sits behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\nTaylor's attacks against Trump were extensive. Among other anecdotes, he revealed that Trump was too distracted to pay attention to intelligence briefings, that Trump refused internal recommendations to punish Moscow for interference in U.S. affairs, and that Trump wanted to \"swap\" Puerto Rico for Greenland because it was \"dirty and the people were poor\". Taylor also said that Trump tried to block emergency aid for California wildfire victims because it was a Democratic state, and that Trump told his homeland security secretary to take marching orders from cable talk-show host Lou Dobbs.In 2020, Taylor, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and \"To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.\"In September 2020, Taylor revealed to The Lincoln Project that, before he resigned from the DHS, a senior presidential adviser told him about a list of executive orders that has been prepared in case President Trump would win a second term, which Taylor alleged were orders deemed unacceptable during a first term presidency because they could harm the president's chances of reelection. Later, BuzzFeed reporter Hamed Aleaziz concluded that Taylor was implying Stephen Miller was that senior presidential adviser, with The Guardian reiterating this claim and reporting that Miller's biographer Jean Guerrero warned about a \"wishlist\" of his relating to immigration policy under a Trump second term.Taylor also told news organizations that Trump ordered officials to have American flags raised back up when they were lowered in honor of Senator John McCain, and that Trump deliberately ignored warnings about the rise of domestic terrorism for political reasons. Taylor was also among those who appeared on a special that aired on CNN in October 2020, entitled, \"The Insiders: A Warning from Former Trump Officials\". During the special, Taylor criticized Trump's singular focus on immigration, especially the border wall, saying that his \"wall-or-nothing approach to governing meant the president ignored some of the most critical homeland security threats to our country, cybersecurity challenges, counterterrorism, manmade and natural disasters, and foreign interference in our democracy.\"In June 2021, Taylor tweeted that he would run in the 2024 United States presidential election as an independent if Trump were to win the Republican nomination. The plan is to split the conservative vote in order to deny Trump a victory, although he later indicated on Twitter that he was not seriously considering being the candidate. In an interview with MSNBC the same month, Taylor stated that \"the number one national security threat I've ever seen in my life to this country's democracy is the party that I'm in \u2014 the Republican Party. It is the number one national security threat to the United States of America,\" ranking his party above \"ISIS, al-Qaeda, and Russia\". He also stated that if House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (a Republican) became Speaker, it would represent \"Trump's hand on that Speaker's gavel.\"",
        "Renew America Movement": "Taylor became a regular CNN contributor in August 2020. Following Trump's loss to Biden, Taylor stepped down from his role at Google, but continued appearing on CNN while working on other projects.In the wake of the May 2021 decision by House Republicans to remove Representative Liz Cheney as conference chair because of her opposition to Trump, Taylor and Evan McMullin organized a group of more than 150 Republicans\u2014including former governors, senators, congressmen, cabinet secretaries, and party leaders\u2014to issue \"A Call for American Renewal\" threatening to form a third party if the Republican Party did not reform itself.In June 2021, Taylor and McMullin launched a new organization, the Renew America Movement (RAM). The organization's stated goal is to recruit candidates in the 2022 elections to challenge candidates who continue to support Trump. In October 2021, Taylor and former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman published an opinion piece in The New York Times announcing that RAM would be supporting \"rational\" Republicans and moderate Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections, with the goal of steering power away from members of the GOP who are pro-Trump. Taylor's group subsequently released a statement that they planned to raise \"tens of millions\" of dollars to defend a designated slate of House and Senate candidates in order to counter Donald Trump's hold on the Republican Party.",
        "The Forward Party": "In July 2022, Taylor merged his organization -- Renew America Movement\u2014with several others to launch a new political party in the United States, alongside former nationally known Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. In announcing the new Forward Party, Taylor told Reuters: \"The fundamentals have changed. When other third party movements have emerged in the past it\u2019s largely been inside a system where the American people aren\u2019t asking for an alternative. The difference here is we are seeing an historic number of Americans saying they want one.\" Taylor",
        "Havana syndrome incidents": "In a 60 Minutes interview in February 2022, Taylor recounted that he had two experiences that matched the Havana syndrome symptoms. Taylor also indicated that he was aware of a cabinet-level official who had similar episodes.",
        "Political affiliations": "Although Taylor was a lifelong member of the Republican Party, he donated to the Barack Obama campaign in the 2008 presidential election. He has said that he was \"gunning for John McCain... [but] wanted to be able to tell [his] kids that... [he] supported the first Black president of the United States.\"In May 2022, Taylor announced he was leaving the Republican Party over what he claimed was its espousal of \"great replacement theory\" rhetoric, especially in the wake of the Buffalo shooting. He stated that \u201cit\u2019s become glaringly obvious that my party no longer represents conservative values but in fact poses a threat to them\u2014and to America.\u201d Taylor is now a member of The Forward Party.",

        "Introduction": "Roy Want is a computer scientist born in London, United Kingdom in 1961. He received his PhD from Cambridge University (UK) in 1988 for his work on multimedia Distributed Systems; and is known for his work on indoor positioning, mobile and ubiquitous computing, automatic identification (e.g. RFID and wireless beacons) and the Internet of Things (IoT). He lives in Silicon Valley, California, and has authored or co-authored over 150 papers and articles on mobile systems, and holds 100+ patents. In 2011 he joined Google as a Senior Research Scientist, and is in the Android group. Previous roles include Senior Principal Engineer at Intel, and Principal Scientist at Xerox PARC...",
        "Projects": "Among his earliest contributions (circa 1988) was the Active Badge system that identified individual mobile users, and their location, to the computing infrastructure inside a building. This pioneering work was done at the Olivetti Research Ltd (ORL) in Cambridge, United Kingdom and its seminal publication has been recognized with the ACM SIGMOBILE Test-of-Time Award (2016). Over 1000 Active Badges were deployed outside Olivetti, at laboratories including DEC SRC, and Xerox PARC. These deployments sparked the creation of the first generation of context-aware software systems in the larger research community.\nWant was a central figure in the earliest realization (at Xerox PARC) of Mark Weiser\u2019s vision of Ubiquitous Computing. The PARC program involved three devices: PARC-Tab, PARC-Pad, and LiveBoard. Today, these form-factors map directly to smartphones, tablets and smart-TVs. In the early 1990s, Want was the principal architect and implementer of PARC-Tab, the world\u2019s first context-aware mobile computer in a smartphone form-factor. It could adapt the behavior of applications, depending on the user\u2019s context, a decade before the emergence of the iPhone (2007).  A key technology that made the PARC-Tab context-aware was the use of an infrared network, both connecting the device to the local area network, and localizing it to a room using a diffuse infrared-network transceiver.\nIn the late 1990\u2019s at PARC, Want also pioneered extending the classic notion of a mobile UI to incorporate inertial sensors, taking advantage of the new MEMS technologies, and designed the Hikari handheld digital organizer. It would automatically change from portrait to landscape format as you rotated it; now a commonplace capability for smartphones. Lists could also be scrolled and items selected using a tilt and clutch mechanism, and photos selected from a 2D grid using a ball-in-a-maze puzzle style of user interface.By the end of 1990s, Want led PARC\u2019s electronic tag project, \u201cBridging Physical and Digital worlds\u201d, based on passive RFID.  It was the first comprehensive published vision that electronic tags (inexpensive, and battery-free), could link the then new mobile platforms with a location, and related digital web content/control; another example of context-aware computingWant continued to make pioneering contributions to mobile computing over the following two decades.  At Intel Research, he led the Personal Server project (2001), a platform later integrated into an early smartphone, which enabled users to present their personal digital content and media onto nearby displays. This led to his vision of Dynamic Composable Computing (2005), in which a mobile user is able to rapidly assemble a logical computer on-the-fly through wireless-connected components. Today, the Personal Server concept is embodied in Apple\u2019s Airplay and Google Cast media services, and as a result the original paper was given the 10-year impact-award at ACM Ubicomp \u201912At Google, Want was one of the leads for the Eddystone Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) beacon project, with similar context-aware goals to RFID, but enhanced by ubiquitous readers in the form of smartphones, which can detect BLE advertisement IDs at much greater range, and now supported commercially by many vendors.",
        "Technical Service": "In addition to his technical contributions, Want has been a dedicated member of the ACM SIGMOBILE community and made many leadership and service contributions.  He was the Chair of SIGMOBILE from 2009-12, and has served as program chair for top tier conferences such as ACM MobiSys, ACM HotMobile, IEEE PerDis, IEEE ISWC; and in the role as Editor-in-Chief for IEEE Pervasive Computing magazine (2006-09) [26-32] and provided Editorial Board contributions to IEEE Computer magazine.\nIn 2019 he became a Technical Editor for the IEEE 802.11az Wi-Fi standard, working on the Next-Generation Positioning standard, and leading the integration of 802.11mc with Android P+ to enable enhanced context-aware operation for more than 2 billion devices with Android P+. The technology was presented publicly at Google IO \u201918, and is expected to lead to ubiquitous (1-2m) indoor location accuracy as the world upgrades its Wi-Fi infrastructure to the latest standards.",
        "Awards": "Want is an ACM Fellow (2005) and IEEE Fellow (2005). In 2003 he also received the Lillian Gilbreth Lectureship award from the US National Academy of Engineering (NAE) for his work on the Intel Personal Server; The Gilbreth Lectures were established in 2001 by the Council of the National Academy of Engineering as a means of recognizing outstanding young American engineers.

    "Sergey Aleynikov": {
        "Introduction": "Sergey Aleynikov (born 1970) is a former Goldman Sachs computer programmer. Between 2009 and 2016, he was prosecuted by NY Federal and State jurisdictions for the same conduct of allegedly copying proprietary computer source code from his employer, Goldman Sachs, before joining a competing firm. His first prosecution in federal court in New York ultimately resulted in acquittal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The outcome of his second prosecution and trial in New York state court was a split verdict dismissed by court, which acquitted him on all counts.  One count in that order of dismissal was later overturned by New York Court of Appeals, which took a very broad interpretation of the statute, and on recommendation of prosecutors he was sentenced to time served without punishment. The same New York Court of Appeals denied his petition to appeal on double jeopardy grounds. His story inspired Michael Lewis's bestseller Flash Boys.",
        "Career": "Around 1990, Sergey Aleynikov emigrated from the Soviet Union to the United States. From 1998 to 2007, he worked at IDT Corporation, writing software to better handle high volumes of phone calls.He authored a telecommunications patent and contributed to a number of open-source Erlang and C++ projects. He also published several Perl modules on CPAN.Aleynikov was employed for two years, from May 2007 to June 2009, at Goldman at an ultimate salary of $400,000. He left to join Misha Malyshev's Teza Technologies, a competing high-frequency trading firm which offered to triple his pay.In May 2010, Aleynikov founded Omnibius, LLC, a consulting services firm for financial clients.",
        "Federal prosecution and acquittal": "On July 3, 2009, he was arrested by FBI agents at Newark Liberty International Airport after Goldman raised the alarm over a suspected policy violation reported by Goldman on July 1, 2009, two days prior to his arrest.  He was accused by the FBI of improperly copying computer source code that performs \"sophisticated, high-speed and high-volume trades on various stock and commodity markets\", as described by Goldman. The events leading to his arrest are covered by Michael Lewis in his 2014 book Flash Boys. According to Assistant United States Attorney Joseph Facciponti, \"the bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways.\". Facciponti's words in the courtroom contradicted to what David Viniar, Goldman's CFO, said a few days later on the earnings call that the sustained losses would be \"very, very immaterial\". Aleynikov acknowledged downloading some source code, but maintained that his intent was to collect exclusively open-source software that is not proprietary to his then-employer.On February 10, 2010, a 3-count indictment was handed down by a federal grand jury in Manhattan. The counts included theft of trade secrets (count 1), transportation of stolen goods (count 2), and illicit obtainment of data from a protected computer (count 3).On July 16, 2010, Aleynikov moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense under any of the three statutes invoked: the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, the National Stolen Property Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He argued that the acts he was accused of did not constitute a crime.  On September 3, 2010, the federal judge, Denise Cote, dismissed the count 3 but denied the rest of the motion.In December 2010, Aleynikov had a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Certain trial proceedings were not public. On December 10, he was convicted of the remaining two counts, including theft of trade secrets and transportation of stolen property. Later, he was sentenced to 97 months (8 years) in prison, three years of supervised release following his prison sentence, and a $12,500 fine, despite the recommendation of the Federal Probation Service of suggesting a 24 month (2 years) sentence.Three weeks before sentencing, Aleynikov was incarcerated on request of the government, as he was judged to be more of a flight risk after separating from his wife.In March 2011, Aleynikov appealed the conviction, asking the Second Circuit to review the District Court's decision denying his original motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to state a claim.On February 16, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral argument on his appeal and, later that day, unanimously ordered his conviction reversed and a judgment of acquittal entered, with opinion to follow. Aleynikov was released from custody the next morning.\nOn April 11, 2012, Dennis Jacobs, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals, published a unanimous decision in a written opinion stating:\n\nOn appeal, Aleynikov argues, inter alia, that his conduct did not constitute an offense under either statute. He argues that: [1] the source code was not a \"stolen\" \"good\" within the meaning of the NSPA, and [2] the source code was not \"related to or included in a product that is produced for or placed in interstate or foreign commerce\" within the meaning of the EEA. We agree, and reverse the judgment of the district court.\nIn the course of these events, Aleynikov has spent a year in prison for crimes he did not commit, has divorced, has lost his savings, and, according to his lawyer, \"[his] life has been all but ruined\" as a result.The government did not seek reconsideration of the Second Circuit's ruling, thus ending federal action against Aleynikov.Later, on December 18, 2012, the Congress enhanced the 1996 Economic Espionage Act, in order to cover similar acts in future rulings, in a law referred to as the \"Theft of trade secrets clarification act of 2012\".",
        "NY State prosecution": "No information",
        "Arrest, trial, and acquittal": "On August 9, 2012, Aleynikov was re-arrested and charged by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr., on behalf of New York State, with \"unlawful use of secret scientific material\" (2 counts) and \"unlawful duplication of computer-related material\" (1 count) based on the same conduct.  The state prosecution was initiated based on a complaint signed by the same federal agent, Michael  McSwain, who led the investigation underlying the failed federal prosecution. Aleynikov's lawyer, Kevin Marino, accused Goldman Sachs of being behind the government's aggressive prosecution. Marino sharply criticized the Manhattan District Attorney's office for charging Aleynikov after his federal conviction had been overturned and he had already served a year in prison:\n[My client] left Russia for freedom and the American way, and he got Franz Kafka and Goldman Sachs.\nOn September 27, 2012, Aleynikov pleaded not guilty to all state charges and rejected the prosecutors' plea offer of accepting a single count offense and serving no jail time.  On April 5, 2013, Aleynikov lost his motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy.  In rendering the decision, New York State Supreme Court Justice Ronald Zweibel stated that Aleynikov's acquittal in federal court only precluded the federal government from retrying Aleynikov.  The state of New York, as a separate sovereign, could continue pursuing charges against him.On June 20, 2014, upon reviewing the evidence, Justice Ronald Zweibel published a 71-page opinion in which the court ruled that the FBI \"did not have probable cause to arrest defendant, let alone search him or his home.\" The arrest was \"illegal\", and Aleynikov's \"Fourth Amendment rights were violated as a result of a mistake of law.\" Besides finding that he was arrested illegally without probable cause, the court excluded the majority of evidence passed by the FBI to state prosecutors, as that property was supposed to be returned to Mr. Aleynikov upon acquittal.\nOn May 1, 2015, following a trial before a New York state jury, he was cleared of the unlawful computer-related material duplication charge but found guilty of one count of unlawfully using secret scientific material. The jury deadlocked on the third count. On July 6, 2015, Justice Daniel P. Conviser dismissed the two remaining charges finding that, as a matter of law, Aleynikov did not violate the statute, and no rational jury could convict him of those charges. In his opinion, he wrote:\nThe Court holds that, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the People, the prosecution did not prove the Defendant made a \"tangible reproduction or representation\" of secret scientific material as required by the statute. The Court also holds, again under the same evidentiary standard, that the People did not demonstrate Aleynikov had the \"intent to appropriate ... the use of secret scientific material\" as required by the law. Defendants cannot be convicted of crimes because we believe as a matter of policy that their conduct warrants prosecution.\nThe statute criminalizing unlawful use of secret scientific material was enacted in 1967 but rarely utilized. The word \"tangible\" had never been defined by the New York Penal Law or in any reported court decision involving that statute. The one reported decision in which the statute did receive legal scrutiny \u2014 People v Russo (131 Misc 2d 677 [Suffolk County Ct 1986, Copertino, J.]) \u2014 was not informative with respect to the issues here.",
        "NY State Appeal": "On April 4, 2016, almost nine months after Aleynikov was acquitted by the NY Supreme Court, the Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's office filed an appeal seeking to reinstate the guilty verdict, arguing that\n\nNo sensible reading of the word 'tangible' supports the trial court's misguided view that the Unlawful Use statute proscribes only the creation of paper copies of secret scientific material. Even assuming the word is given its narrowest possible definition, 'perceptible to the touch,' [...] a digital reproduction of data is no less tangible than a paper copy. Computer code, in its essence, is intellectual property, just like a song or a formula. When intellectual property is written on paper, it is no more 'perceptible to the touch' than it is when written onto a hard drive. In neither case can a person 'touch' the intellectual property. In both scenarios, however, a person can touch the medium onto which the property is reproduced or recorded. This is true whether information is inscribed on a tablet, written on paper, saved onto a hard drive, or photographed with a digital camera. In each instance, the information is reproduced in a manner that gives it physical existence \u2013 in other words, a tangible reproduction or representation.\nDefense attorney Kevin Marino denounced Mr. Vance's actions:\n\nTo re-prosecute Sergey Aleynikov \u2013 who was acquitted of all federal charges after spending a year in prison \u2013 was reprehensible; to file this baseless appeal eight months after Mr. Aleynikov was likewise acquitted of all state charges is truly inexcusable. Is no one watching how Mr. Vance spends the taxpayers' money?\nOn January 24, 2017, Aleynikov's conviction was reinstated by the First Department of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court.  The appellate court found the trial court's reasoning\u2014that an electronic copy of the code was not a \"tangible\" reproduction\u2014made \"little sense,\" as a compact disc and a thumb drive are both \"unquestionably tangible.\"  The appellate court also found that the trial court erred in concluding that Aleynikov lacked \"intent to appropriate,\" holding that the evidence \"permits a rational inference that defendant intended to exercise permanent control over the use of Goldman's source code, as opposed to a short-term borrowing.\" Aleynikov's lawyer has stated that he will seek \"immediate leave to appeal\" the decision.In the opinion on the 330.30 motion, the trial court's judge criticized decision of the appellate court:\n\nEven were the proper construction of the word \"tangible\" a close call, however, this Court believed the Rule of Lenity compelled the dismissal of the charges here. \"If two constructions of a criminal statute are plausible, the one more favorable to the defendant should be adopted ... \" People v. Golb , 23 N.Y.3d 455, 468, 991 N.Y.S.2d 792, 15 N.E.3d 805 (2014). ... Neither the First Department nor the New York Court of Appeals mentioned the Rule of Lenity or any equivalent doctrine in their decisions.\nOn April 20, 2017 New York Court of Appeals granted Aleynikov's motion to appeal the reversal decision of the intermediate New York's appellate court.  The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Appellate Division on May 3, 2018, and he was sentenced to time served.  Aleynikov's lawyer, Kevin Marino, criticized the conviction, and indicated that he will appeal the outcome:\n\nMr. Aleynikov was twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense. He was acquitted in federal court because the source code copy he made was not tangible and convicted in state court because it was tangible. That\u2019s double jeopardy. And if they were going to ask for time served, why did they waste six years and millions of taxpayer dollars pursuing this case? It is an appalling abuse of power by an office becoming well-known for it.",
        "Malicious prosecution lawsuit": "Aleynikov sued the FBI agents who arrested him for malicious prosecution. The judge dismissed the case with respect to Aleynikov's federal prosecution, finding that the agents were warranted in believing that Aleynikov had violated the National Stolen Property Act and the Economic Espionage Act. Aleynikov's malicious prosecution claims in connection with his prosecution in New York state court were stayed pending the District Attorney's appeal of the New York trial court's decision to set aside his conviction.",

        "Introduction": "Clifford Scott Asness (; born October 17, 1966) is an American hedge fund manager and the co-founder of AQR Capital Management.",
        "Early life and early education": "Asness was born to a Jewish family, in Queens, New York, the son of Carol, who ran a medical education firm, and Barry Asness, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan. His family moved to Roslyn Heights, New York when he was four. He attended the B'nai B'rith Perlman Camp and graduated from Herricks High School.",
        "Education": "His undergraduate studies at University of Pennsylvania included a double major in which he studied computer science and finance at Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&T). In 1988, he graduated summa cum laude. Asness's interest in finance and portfolio management began, while he worked a research assistant in the Finance Department at Wharton, and learned to use \"coding computer programs\" to analyze markets\" and \"test economic and financial theories\".In 1994, Asness completed his PhD in finance at the University of Chicago. Asness was the Teaching Assistant (TA) for his dissertation adviser, Nobel laureate Eugene Fama Fama\u2014who was also Asness' mentor \u2014and the economist, Kenneth French, who were both influential and widely-respected empirical financial economists, had established the foundations of their Fama\u2013French three-factor model in 1992.  Fama and French had contrasted value stocks with growth stocks. Since Fama and French's inception of value stocks, \"quants have designed algorithms that can scour market data\" looking for \"factors\".Asness' doctoral dissertation was on \"the performance of momentum trading, buying stocks with rising prices\". Asness asserted that profits consistently beating market averages were attainable by exploiting both value and momentum. Asness concept of value was referred to in the context of fundamental analysis as a way of assessing the true worth of a security. His use of the concept of momentum referred to betting that the value will continue to go up or down as it did in the recent past. While he did not originate these concepts, Asness was credited with being the first to compile enough empirical evidence across a wide variety of markets to bring the ideas into the academic financial mainstream.",
        "Global Alpha": "Asness started his career in 1990, when he was 24 and still a PhD student. In the early 1990s, he had left academia, to the regret of his mentor, to become manager of Goldman Sachs Asset Management's (GSAM) \"new quantitative research desk\". He invited two friends from his cohort at the University of Chicago to join him at GSAM. Together, they began \"developing models to evaluate risk in currencies, bonds and entire economies.\" While the \"idea of factors\" came from Fama and French, it was first \"put into practice\" in the late 1990s by Asness, according to The Economist.Asness and his team at GSAM, built on Fama and French's idea of factors, and combined their work with insights he had gained from his own PhD research.Asness worked as GSAM manager until 1997, when he and some members of the GSAM team, left to start their own quant hedge fund.In 1995, Asness persuaded a few partners at Goldman to provide him with an initial US$10-million investment to employ the computer-driven models that his team had developed, to invest in the market.When the $10 million initial investment reached $100 million, Goldman opened the fund to the public\u2014the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund. Global Alpha, a systematic trading hedge fund was one of the earliest \"quant vehicles\" in the industry. The fund became known for high-frequency trading and furthered the careers of Asness and Mark Carhart. Asness and his team used complicated computerized trading models to first locate underpriced equities, bonds, currencies, and commodities and then use short selling to take advantage of upward or downward price momentum. The fund was designed to make money regardless of the direction the market was moving. The Wall Street Journal described Asness and Carhart as \"gurus\" who managed Global Alpha, a \"big, secretive hedge fund\"\u2014the \"Cadillac of a fleet of alternative investments\" that had made millions for Goldman Sachs by 2006. By 2007, at its height, Global Alpha was \"one of the biggest and best performing hedge funds in the world\" with more than $12 billion assets under management (AUM). Global Alpha was shutdown in the fall of 2011. The quant fund had declined significantly by mid-2008, and continued its decline to $1 billion AUM through 2011.",
        "AQR Capital": "In 1998 in New York, when he was 31-years old, Asness,  David Kabiller, John Liew, and Robert Krail, co-founded AQR Capital Management\u2014a \"quantitative hedge fund firm\".In 2002, Asness made $37 million, and in 2003, he made $50 million. In 2004, AQR moved its headquarters from New York to Greenwich, Connecticut.AQR\u2014Applied Quantitative Research\u2014suffered losses during both the \"2007 quant meltdown\" and the 2008 financial crisisBy the end of 2010, AQR had $33 billion assets under management (AUM).An October 2010 Bloomberg article, described AQR as a \"quantitative investment firm\" that used \"algorithms and computerized models to trade stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.\"In 2016, Connecticut's State Bond Commission gave $35 million in financial aid to AQR, as part of a \"broader move by the Connecticut government to persuade companies\", including Bridgewater Associates, the biggest hedge fund in the world, to remain in Connecticut. AQR's $28 million loan, would be \"forgiven\" if AQR kept \"540 jobs within Connecticut\" and created 600 new jobs by 2026. AQR received grants worth $7 million to \"help pay for an expansion.\"By 2017, according to Forbes, Asness had \"moved away from hedge funds\" and aggressively promoted lower-fees, more \"liquid and transparent products\", such as \"mutual funds, that use computer models, often to replicate hedge fund returns\".By 2019, AQR had become an \"investment firm\"\u2014running \"one of the world's largest hedge funds\". A 2020 Forbes profile described AQR (Applied Quantitative Research) as an agency that employs \"factor-based investing,\" and offers products ranging from hedge funds to mutual funds.",
        "Selected academic publications": "In a co-authored 2001 article published in the Journal of Portfolio Management, the authors described how, while some hedge fund managers are skilled in picking stocks, not all use effective methods. In their 2003 publication in the Financial Analysts Journal, Arnott and Asness wrote that contrary to prevailing theory, companies that paid higher dividends, actually had higher growth in earnings. They found that low payout ratios \"preceded low earnings growth.\" In a 2003 Journal of Portfolio Management article, Asness said that it was a mistake to compare stock market's P/E ratio\u2014earnings yield\u2014to interest rates (called the Fed model).In a 2013 co-authored article published in The Journal of Finance, Asness, Tobias Moskowitz, and Lasse Pedersen found \"consistent value and momentum return premia across eight diverse markets and asset classes, and a strong common factor structure among their returns.\" Since this strategy for accumulation is subject to the same constraints as any other and systemic effects in markets can invalidate it: AQR and other similar ventures lost massive amounts of wealth in the Financial crisis of 2007-2010 with assets declining from $39 billion in 2007 to $17 billion by the end of 2008.",
        "Net worth": "According to an April 2020 Forbes' profile, Asness' estimated net worth was $2.6 billion.",
        "Publications about Asness": "The New York Times published a profile of Asness on June 5, 2005. The Times said that \"what Asness really does is try to understand the relationship between risk and reward.\"Asness was featured in Scott Patterson's 2010 publication, The Quants, along with  Aaron Brown from AQR Capital Management, Ken Griffin from Chicago's Citadel LLC, James Simons from Renaissance Technologies, and Boaz Weinstein from Deutsche Bank.  a \"scourge of bad practices in the money management industry\" with the \"intellectual chops to back up his attacks\". Patterson said that Asness was known as \"one of the smartest investors in the world.\" He had been a \"standout student at the University of Chicago's prestigious economics department in the early 1990s, then a star at Goldman Sachs in the mid-1990s before branching out on his own in 1998 to launch AQR with $1 billion and change, a near record at the time.\"",

    "Steve Bannon": {
        "Introduction": "Stephen Kevin Bannon (born November 27, 1953) is an American media executive, political strategist, and former investment banker. He served as the White House's chief strategist in the administration of U.S. president Donald Trump during the first seven months of Trump's term. He is a former executive chairman of Breitbart News and previously served on the board of the now-defunct data-analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.Bannon was an officer in the United States Navy for seven years in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After his military service, he worked for two years at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker. In 1993, he became acting director of the research project Biosphere 2. He became an executive producer in Hollywood, producing 18 films between 1991 and 2016. In 2007, he co-founded Breitbart News, a far-right website which he described in 2016 as \"the platform for the alt-right\".In 2016, Bannon became the chief executive officer of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was appointed chief strategist and senior counselor to the president following Trump's election. He left the position eight months later and rejoined Breitbart. In January 2018, Bannon was disavowed by Trump for critical comments reported in the book Fire and Fury, and left Breitbart.\nAfter leaving the White House, Bannon opposed the Republican Party establishment and supported insurgent candidates in Republican primary elections. Bannon's reputation as a political strategist was questioned when former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore, despite Bannon's support, lost the 2017 United States Senate election in Alabama to Democrat Doug Jones. Bannon had declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement\". Accordingly, he has supported many national populist conservative political movements around the world, including creating a network of far-right groups in Europe.\nIn August 2020, Bannon and three others were arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and money laundering in connection with the We Build the Wall fundraising campaign. According to the grand jury indictment, Bannon and the defendants promised that all contributions would go to building a U.S.\u2013Mexico border wall, but instead enriched themselves. Bannon pleaded not guilty. On January 20, 2021, on his last day in office, Trump pardoned Bannon, sparing him from a federal trial. Federal pardons do not cover state offenses, and in September 2022, Bannon was charged in New York state court on counts of fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy in connection to the \"We Build The Wall\" campaign.In November 2020, Bannon's Twitter account was permanently suspended after he suggested that the federal government's infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci and FBI director Christopher Wray should be executed.Bannon was held in contempt of Congress in October 2021 after he refused to comply with a subpoena issued by the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, the U.S. House of Representatives committee investigating the 2021 United States Capitol attack. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on two criminal charges of contempt of Congress. In July 2022, he was convicted on both counts in a jury trial. He was sentenced on October 21, 2022, to four months in prison and a $6,500 fine. He is appealing his conviction and sentence, and his sentence was put on hold pending the appeal.",
        "Early life": "Stephen Kevin Bannon was born November 27, 1953, in Norfolk, Virginia, to Doris (n\u00e9e Herr), a homemaker, and Martin J. Bannon Jr., who worked as an AT&T telephone lineman and as a middle manager. He grew up in a working-class family that was pro-Kennedy and pro-union Democrat. He is of Irish and German descent. Much of his mother's side of the family settled in the Baltimore area. Bannon graduated from Benedictine College Preparatory, a private, Catholic, military high school in Richmond, Virginia, in 1971, and then attended Virginia Tech, where he served as the president of the student government association. During the summers he worked at a local junkyard.In 1976 he graduated from Virginia Tech College of Architecture and Urban Studies with a bachelor's degree in urban planning.

Foster as a surface warfare officer in the Pacific Fleet, and afterwards as a special assistant to the chief of naval operations at the Pentagon. Bannon's job at the Pentagon was, among other things, handling messages between senior officers and writing reports about the state of the Navy fleet worldwide. While at the Pentagon, Bannon attended Georgetown University at night and obtained his master's degree in national security studies.In 1980, Bannon was deployed to the Persian Gulf to assist with Operation Eagle Claw during the Iran hostage crisis. In a 2015 interview, Bannon said that the mission's failure marked a turning point in his political world-view from largely apolitical to strongly Reaganite, which was further reinforced by the September 11 attacks. He recounted, \"I wasn't political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter fucked things up. I became a huge Reagan admirer. Still am. But what turned me against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that [George W.] Bush had fucked up as badly as Carter. The whole country was a disaster.\"",

He stayed at this position with Goldman in Los Angeles for two years, and left with the title of vice president.",
        "Pivot in career into media and investing": "In 1990, Bannon and several colleagues from Goldman Sachs launched their own company Bannon & Co., a boutique investment bank specializing in media. In one of Bannon & Co.'s transactions, the firm represented Westinghouse Electric which wanted to sell Castle Rock Entertainment. Bannon negotiated a sale of Castle Rock to Turner Broadcasting System, which was owned by Ted Turner at the time. Instead of a full adviser's fee, Bannon & Co. accepted a financial stake in five television shows, including Seinfeld, which was in its third season. Bannon still receives cash residuals each time Seinfeld is aired.Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale purchased Bannon & Co. in 1998.",

Under Bannon, the closed-system experiment project shifted emphasis from researching human space exploration and colonization toward the scientific study of earth's environment, pollution, and climate change. He left the project in 1995.",
        "Entertainment and media": "In the 1990s, Bannon ventured into entertainment and media, and became an executive producer in the Hollywood film and media industry. Bannon produced 18 films, from Sean Penn's drama The Indian Runner (1991) to Julie Taymor's film Titus (1999). Bannon became a partner with entertainment industry executive Jeff Kwatinetz at film and television management company The Firm, Inc., 2002\u20132003.In 2004, Bannon made a documentary about Ronald Reagan titled In the Face of Evil. Through the making and screening of this film, Bannon was introduced to Reagan's War author Peter Schweizer and publisher Andrew Breitbart, who would later describe him as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movement. Bannon was involved in the financing and production of a number of films, including Fire from the Heartland: The Awakening of the Conservative Woman (2010), The Undefeated (2011), and Occupy Unmasked (2012).Bannon persuaded Goldman Sachs to invest, in 2006, in a company known as Internet Gaming Entertainment. Following a lawsuit, the company rebranded as Affinity Media, and Bannon took over as CEO. From 2007 through 2011, Bannon was the chair and CEO of Affinity Media.In 2007, Bannon wrote an eight-page treatment for a new documentary called Destroying the Great Satan: The Rise of Islamic Facism (sic) in America. The outline states that \"although driven by the 'best intentions,' institutions such as the media, the Jewish community and government agencies were appeasing jihadists aiming to create an Islamic republic.\" In 2011, Bannon spoke at the Liberty Restoration Foundation in Orlando, Florida, about the Economic Crisis of 2008, the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and their impact in the origins of the Tea Party movement, while also discussing his films Generation Zero (2010) and The Undefeated.",
        "Breitbart News": "Bannon was a founding member of the board of Breitbart News, a far-right news, opinion and commentary website. Philip Elliott and Zeke J. Miller of Time have said that the site has \"pushed racist, sexist, xenophobic and antisemitic material into the vein of the alternative right\". Bannon said that Breitbart's ideological mix included libertarians, Zionists, the conservative gay community, same-sex marriage opponents, economic nationalists, populists, as well as the alt-right, with the alt-right comprising a very small proportion overall. Conceding the alt-right holds views with \"racial and anti-Semitic overtones,\" Bannon said he has zero tolerance for such views.In March 2012, after founder Andrew Breitbart's death, Bannon became executive chairman of Breitbart News LLC, the parent company of Breitbart News. Under his leadership, Breitbart's editorial tone became more nationalistic, and also became increasingly friendly to the alt-right. In 2016, Bannon declared the website \"the platform for the alt-right\". Speaking about his role at Breitbart, Bannon said, \"We think of ourselves as virulently anti-establishment, particularly 'anti-' the permanent political class.\" Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor and colleague of Bannon, called Bannon a \"'bully' who 'sold out [Breitbart founder] Andrew's mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump.'\"On August 18, 2017, Breitbart announced that Bannon would return as executive chairman following his period of employment at the White House. Because of the break with Trump, Bannon's position as head of Breitbart News was called into question by Breitbart's owners, and on January 9, 2018, he stepped down as executive chairman. The billionaire funders of Breitbart, Robert and Rebekah Mercer, reportedly decided to push out Bannon from Breitbart in part because of his break with Trump, and in part because they had become weary of Bannon's \"impulsive and attention-seeking antics\" and Bannon's expenditures on \"travel and private security.\"Bannon hosted a radio show (Breitbart News Daily) on the SiriusXM Patriot satellite radio channel.",
        "Other media activities": "In 2005, Bannon secured $60 million in funding from Goldman Sachs and other investors for IGE (Internet Gaming Entertainment), a company based in Hong Kong that employed \"low-wage Chinese workers\" to play World of Warcraft, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, in order to earn gold in-game that could be traded for virtual items, which could then be sold to players of the video game for real-world money.While some gamers liked IGE's offers of World of Warcraft money that would normally take hours to farm, other gamers called it cheating. Many gamers responded by posting anti-Chinese vitriol. Blizzard Entertainment, the owners of the video game, eventually shut down accounts used by \"gold farmers\". IGE was also the target of a class action lawsuit by a player who said that IGE's practices were \"substantially impairing\" people's enjoyment of the game.While this business model by IGE failed in the end, Bannon became interested in the game's online community, describing its members as \"rootless white males, [who] had monster power.\" Through Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos, whom Bannon recruited, Bannon realized that he could \"activate that army.\" of gamers and Internet trolls, adding that \"They c[a]me in through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned onto politics and Trump.\"Since 2019, Bannon has hosted Bannon's War Room on Robert J. Sigg's Real America's Voice television network, podcast platforms, and on the radio.",
        "Government Accountability Institute": "Bannon was executive chair and co-founder of the Government Accountability Institute, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization where he helped orchestrate the publication of Breitbart News senior Editor-at-large Peter Schweizer's book Clinton Cash, from its founding in 2012 until his departure in August 2016. The organization creates fact-based indictments against politicians using the deep web, tax filings, flight logs, and foreign government documents and then forwards their findings to the media. The organization is registered as nonpartisan but it mainly investigates alleged corruption, crony capitalism, and misuse of taxpayer money within the Democratic Party. The group has spread conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. For the years 2012 through 2015, he received between $81,000 and $100,000 each year; the organization reported that he worked an average of 30 hours per week for the organization.",
        "Cambridge Analytica": "Bannon served as vice president of the board of Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm owned largely by the Mercer family, who also co-owns Breitbart News; the firm allegedly used illegal tactics to target American voters in the 2016 election. According to former Analytica employee Christopher Wylie, Bannon oversaw the collection of Facebook data which was used to target American voters. Wylie who helped with creation of the company referred to the company as a \"psychological warfare tool\". Bannon was paid more than $125,000 for his work at Cambride Analytica. Bannon's stake in Cambridge Analytica was estimated at between 1 and 5 million dollars, but he sold his stake in the company once he joined the Trump administration in April 2017.",
        "The Movement": "In 2017, Bannon founded the Movement, a populist organization which frequently promotes right wing populist groups in Europe which are against the EU government and political system in Europe. The group is also known for its opposition to George Soros's Open Society Foundations, Bannon has referred to Soros as \"evil but brilliant\". The organization employees 10 full time staff members. Mischa\u00ebl Modrikamen, the leader of the Belgian People's Party, serves as executive director. The organization has received praise from figures like Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Italian Eurosceptic party M5S leader Luigi Di Maio.",
        "Brief political career": "No information",
        "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign": "On August 17, 2016, with 88 days until the 2016 presidential election, Bannon was appointed chief executive of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Bannon left Breitbart, as well as the Government Accountability Institute and Cambridge Analytica, to take the job. Shortly after he had assumed the chief executive role, the chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, was dismissed.\n\nOn November 13, following Donald Trump's election to the presidency, Bannon was appointed chief strategist and senior counselor to the president-elect. His appointment drew opposition from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republican strategists because of statements in Breitbart News that were alleged to be racist or antisemitic. However, a number of prominent Jews of the (politically) conservative persuasion defended Bannon against the allegations of anti-Semitism, including Ben Shapiro, David Horowitz, Pamela Geller, Bernard Marcus of the Republican Jewish Coalition, Morton Klein, the Zionist Organization of America, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.Alan Dershowitz at first defended Bannon, saying there was no evidence he was antisemitic, but then in a later piece stated that Bannon had made bigoted statements against Muslims, women, and others. The ADL stated \"We are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements from Bannon.\" Bannon had referred to French National Front (now National Rally) politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen as \"the new rising star\".On November 15, 2016, U.S. representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island released a letter to Trump signed by 169 Democratic House representatives urging the president-elect to rescind his appointment of Bannon. The letter stated that appointing Bannon \"sends a disturbing message about what kind of president Donald Trump wants to be\", because his \"ties to the White Nationalist movement have been well documented\"; it went on to present several examples of Breitbart News's alleged xenophobia. Bannon denied being a white nationalist and said, rather, that he was an \"economic nationalist.\"On November 18, during his first interview not conducted by Breitbart Media since the 2016 presidential election, Bannon remarked on some criticisms made about him, saying, \"Darkness is good: Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power. It only helps us when they get it wrong. When they're blind to who we are and what we're doing.\" The quote was published widely in the media.In an interview with The New York Times in late November, Trump responded to the controversy over Bannon's appointment, saying, \"I've known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right, or any of the things that we can, you know, the terms we can use, I wouldn't even think about hiring him.\"In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Bannon said that his role was to \"recalibrate\" the campaign, which had at that point lost its message. He \"stepped in and got the campaign refocused\", but he rebuffed the idea that he was the reason Trump won the presidency, saying \"Trump is unique in American political history, he's his own closer.\" Bannon said his role was to make sure that Hillary Clinton was held up as a \"guardian of a corrupt and incompetent establishment\" and this that was key to winning votes in states that Trump needed to win.Reuters reported on October 31, 2018, that the Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting a \"wide-ranging\" investigation of Bannon's activities during the campaign, including knowledge he may have had about any contacts between Russia and two campaign advisors, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, as well as his role with Cambridge Analytica.",
        "Trump administration": "No information",
        "Transition to the presidency": "In 2018, Michael Lewis published a quote ascribed to Bannon, made while the transition team for Trump was supposed to be preparing for the next administration, and The Guardian used it twice in the title of an excerpt from the 2018 Lewis book The Fifth Risk. The book examined the difference between the transition preparations provided by the administration that was exiting and what did or did not occur, and it revealed a profound lack of preparedness and concern, as expressed in the quote.",
        "National Security Council": "At the end of January 2017, in a departure from the previous format of the National Security Council (NSC), the holder of Bannon's position, along with that of the chief of staff, were designated by presidential memorandum as regular attendees to the NSC's Principals Committee, a Cabinet-level senior inter-agency forum for considering national security issues. The enacted arrangement was criticized by several members of previous administrations and was called \"stone cold crazy\" by Susan E. Rice, Barack Obama's last national security adviser. In response, White House press secretary Sean Spicer pointed to Bannon's seven years experience as a Navy officer in justifying his presence on the committee.",
        "Presidency of Donald Trump": "Upon his inauguration, Trump appointed Bannon to be his chief strategist, a newly created position. The title made him a counselor to the president, nearly equivalent in authority to the chief of staff. As a staff member in the Executive Office of the President, the position did not require Senate confirmation. Breitbart News editor Julia Hahn followed Bannon to the White House, where she was appointed as Bannon's aide, as well as special assistant to President Trump.In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in the aftermath of the 2016 election, Bannon analogized his influence with Trump to that of \"Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors\".Several days after Trump's inauguration, Bannon told The New York Times, \"The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while. I want you to quote this: the media here is the opposition party. They don't understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.\"Bannon, along with Stephen Miller, was involved in the creation of Executive Order 13769, which resulted in restricted U.S. travel and immigration by individuals from seven countries, suspension of the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days, and indefinite suspension of the entry of Syrians to the United States. According to The Economist, a British news magazine, Bannon and Miller \"see Mr [Vladimir] Putin as a fellow nationalist and crusader against cosmopolitanism.\"\n\nIn February 2017, Bannon appeared on the cover of Time, on which he was labeled \"the Great Manipulator\". The headline used for the associated article was \"Is Steve Bannon the Second Most Powerful Man in the World?\", alluding to Bannon's perceived influence in the White House.In a March 14, 2019 hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Commerce Department secretary Wilbur Ross was questioned about his conversations regarding the adding of a citizenship question to the 2020 census surveys, which he had with Bannon, who in turn had referred him to immigration hardliners Kris Kobach and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Missouri Democratic representative Lacy Clay accused Ross of being \"complicit\" regarding his efforts to weaken minority group voting rights, additionally accusing him of committing perjury with respect to those contacts. Clay called for Ross to tender his resignation, saying, \"You lied to Congress. You misled the American people and you are complicit in the Trump administration's intent to suppress the growing political power of the non-white population.\" Ross said the change was in response to a request by the Justice Department for statistics to protect voting rights. On April 23, 2019, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments regarding appeals of rejections by three circuit courts of the proposed inclusion of the survey question.It was reported that Bannon intentionally published stories to undermine H. R. McMaster. Bannon allegedly did this by leaking information to the alternative media, including alt-right writer Mike Cernovich. It was also reported that the Trump administration retroactively granted Bannon a blanket exemption from federal ethics rules that allowed him to communicate with editors at Breitbart News, which according to former Breitbart consultant Kurt Bardella would be proof of the administration's intent to allow him to continue being \"the de facto editorial director of Breitbart\" (italics added). In the final hours of Donald Trump's administration, Steve Bannon was issued a presidential pardon. The accompanying announcement said he was \"an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen.\"Bannon was removed from his NSC role in early April 2017 in a reorganization by U.S. national security advisor H. R. McMaster, whom Bannon had helped select. Some White House officials said Bannon's main purpose in serving on the committee was as a check against former national security advisor Michael T. Flynn, who had resigned in February 2017 for misleading the vice president about a conversation with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Hence, with Flynn gone, Bannon was no longer needed. Bannon reportedly opposed his removal from the council and threatened to quit if President Trump went forward with it, although Republican megadonor Rebekah Mercer urged him to stay. The White House said Bannon had not attempted to leave, and Bannon said any indication that he threatened resignation was \"total nonsense\". Bannon only attended one NSC meeting.",
        "Russia investigation": "Bannon was interviewed multiple times by Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election. Bannon was reportedly interviewed about Roger Stone's contact with Wikileaks. In November 2019, Bannon gave evidence in the federal criminal trial of Roger Stone. Bannon did not voluntarily testify; rather, he was compelled to give evidence under subpoena. Bannon testified that Stone was WikiLeaks' access point for the Trump campaign; the testimony helped establish that Stone lied to Congress. Stone was subsequently convicted on all charges (lying to Congress and witness tampering), but on July 10, 2020, his federal prison sentence was commuted by President Trump. Asked for a comment after Bannon himself was arrested on August 20, 2020, Stone replied, \"Karma is a bitch. But I am praying for him.\"In August 2020 members of the senate intelligence committee told the DOJ they believed that Bannon, Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump Jr. may have misled them with their testimony about Russia investigation.",
        "Quotes in Michael Wolff books": "In January 2018, upon the publication of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which attributed many controversial and inflammatory statements to Bannon, Bannon and Trump became estranged and were widely seen as enemies. The book quoted Bannon as saying that Ivanka Trump was \"as dumb as a brick\"; that the meeting among Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and agents of Russia was \"treasonous\"; and that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller would cause Donald Trump Jr. to \"crack like an egg on live television\". Bannon also warned that investigators would likely uncover money laundering involving Jared Kushner and his family business loans from Deutsche Bank.In his 2019 book Siege, Wolff wrote, \"Trump was vulnerable because for 40 years he had run what increasingly seemed to resemble a semi-criminal enterprise,\" then quoted Bannon as saying, \"I think we can drop the 'semi' part.\" Wolff wrote that Bannon predicted investigations into Trump's finances would be his political downfall, quoting Bannon as saying, \"This is where it isn't a witch hunt \u2013 even for the hard core, this is where he turns into just a crooked business guy, and one worth $50 million instead of $10 billion. Not the billionaire he said he was, just another scumbag.\"",
        "Relationship with Donald Trump": "In January 2018, after excerpts from Fire and Fury were published, Trump promptly disavowed Bannon, saying that Bannon \"lost his mind\" when he left the White House, and attacking him in multiple angry statements. Trump asserted in a tweet that Bannon had \"cried when he got fired and begged for his job\" and publicly referred to Bannon with an unflattering nickname (\"Sloppy Steve\") in reference to Bannon's disheveled appearance. On January 7, 2018, Bannon expressed regret over his delayed response, declared his \"unwavering\" support for Trump and his agenda, and praised Donald Trump Jr. Bannon said his remarks about the campaign meeting were aimed at Manafort instead of Trump Jr., a detail which Wolff contested.Despite Trump's disparagement of him, Bannon retained ties with Trump. In an appearance in August 2019 on CNBC, Bannon praised Trump as a \"great leader as president\" and \"amazing campaigner\"; in response, Trump called Bannon \"one of my best pupils\" and \"still a giant Trump fan\" and said he \"loved working with\" Bannon. In 2018, Bannon released a pro-Trump documentary, Trump @War through his production company, Victory Films; the film aimed to galvanize Trump supporters ahead of the 2018 elections in a bid to keep a Republican majority in the House. In October 2019, Bannon began co-hosting War Room: Impeachment, a daily radio show and podcast in which he offered advice to the Trump administration and its allies on how to counter the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. In 2020, Bannon began a podcast War Room: Pandemic, broadcast from his Capitol Hill townhouse; Bannon told friends that Trump had \"told others that he watches the program and that the president was familiar enough with it to cite specific interviews he had seen when the two men spoke this summer.\" A February 2023 Brookings Institution study found Bannon's podcast contained the highest proportion of false, misleading and unsubstantiated statements among 36,603 episodes produced by 79 prominent political podcasters.",
        "Departure from the White House": "Bannon's employment in the White House ended on August 18, 2017, less than a week after the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally which degenerated into violence and acrimony. Whereas members of both political parties condemned the hatred and violence of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists, The New York Times noted that Trump \"was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides'.\" The decision to blame \"many sides\" was reported to have come from Bannon. The NAACP released a statement saying that while they \"acknowledge and appreciate President Trump's disavowment of the hatred which has resulted in a loss of life today,\" they called on Trump \"to take the tangible step to remove Steve Bannon \u2013 a well-known white supremacist leader \u2013 from his team of advisers\". The statement further described Bannon as a \"symbol of white nationalism\" who \"energized that sentiment\" through his current position within the White House.Some sources stated that White House chief of staff John F. Kelly asked Bannon on August 18, 2017, to submit his immediate resignation in lieu of being fired. Bannon, however, stated he was not fired but rather submitted his two-week resignation notice on August 4, 2017. He reminded The Weekly Standard that he had joined then-presidential candidate Trump's campaign on August 14, 2016, and said he'd \"always planned on spending one year,\" but that he stayed a few more days due to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.In an official statement, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: \"John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. We are grateful for his service and wish him the best.\"The same day, Breitbart News announced that Bannon would return to the site as executive chairman. Several weeks after his departure it was reported that Trump still called Bannon using his personal cell phone, and was only calling when chief of staff Kelly was not around. The Washington Post reported in October 2017 that Trump and Bannon remained in regular contact.",
        "Republican Senate primaries": "Bannon has made efforts to unseat incumbent Republican members of Congress he deemed to be insufficiently supportive of Trump's agenda. In October 2017, Bannon said he planned to sponsor primary challenges against six of the seven incumbent Republican senators in the 2018 elections. He said he had two requirements for a candidate to earn his support: they must pledge to vote against Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader and to end the Senate filibuster. Bannon used his group Citizens of the American Republic to aide him in his efforts to help keep Republican control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 election. The group is a dark money organization; Bannon declined to \"describe his donors or how much money the group has raised.\"Bannon received credit for helping Roy Moore defeat incumbent senator Luther Strange in the September Republican primary for the 2017 special Alabama Senate election, despite Trump's having endorsed Strange. After nine women alleged sexual misconduct, Bannon doubled down on his support for the candidate, raising doubt about the veracity of the accusations. When Ivanka Trump condemned Moore's campaign in Alabama, saying \"there's a special place in hell for people who prey on children\", Bannon responded, \"What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?\", in reference to a woman who accused Trump and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein of raping her at that age.\nIn what had been considered a safe Republican seat, Moore lost the election on December 12, 2017. Bannon's reputation as a political strategist was subsequently questioned by Republican commentators.",
        "Post-White House career": "No information",
        "Work abroad": "After leaving the White House, Bannon declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement.\" He toured Europe to speak at events with various far-right political parties there, in a bid to build a network of right-wing populist-nationalist parties aspiring to government. Bannon visited  the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Freedom Party of Austria, the UK Conservative Party, the Swiss People's Party, the UK Independence Party, the Flemish Vlaams Belang, the Belgian People's Party,Alternative for Germany, France's National Front (now the National Rally), the Italian League, the Brothers of Italy, Hungary's Fidesz, the Sweden Democrats,  the Polish Law and Justice,  Spain's Vox, the Finns Party, the pan-European identitarian movement, Republika Srpska's Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, the Five Star Movement, and the Israeli Likud. Bannon believes that these movements \u2013 along with Japan's Shinzo Abe, India's Narendra Modi, Russia's Vladimir Putin, Saudi Arabia's Mohammad bin Salman, China's Xi Jinping, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and Trump, as well as similar leaders in Egypt, the Philippines, Poland, and South Korea \u2013 are part of a global shift towards nationalism. Bannon's attempt to build a network of far-right parties in Europe had only limited success; while he appeared at events with the French National Rally's Marine Le Pen and the Italian League's Matteo Salvini, the Sweden Democrats said that it had \"no interest\" in Bannon's initiative, the Flemish Vlaams Belang called it \"poorly organized,\" and the Alternative for Germany cited divergent views among the parties. Right-wing populist parties did not achieve a surge in support in the 2019 European Parliament elections. The Atlantic cited a number of factors inhibiting Bannon's project, including differing national and ideological views among the European far right and U.S.-skeptical views held by some parties of the European extreme right.Bannon supports the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, a right-wing Catholic organization in Italy formerly based in what was previously Trisulti Charterhouse; Bannon drafted a leadership course curriculum for the group to train conservative Catholic political activists. In 2018, Bannon announced that he planned to establish a right-wing academy on the site, with the support of Benjamin Harnwell, a British associate of Bannon's who underwrote the project and aimed to create a \"gladiator school for culture warriors.\" However, in 2019, the group's rights to use the former monastery were revoked by the Italian government because it determined that the lessee Dignitatis Humanae Institute failed to meet several criteria to operate the monastery and failed in its obligation to pay a \"concession fee\" as well as maintenance and security expenses.In August 2018, Bannon met with Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, and served as informal advisor to the Bolsonaro campaign in the Brazilian presidential elections that year. In February 2019, the younger Bolsonaro joined Bannon's organization the Movement as its representative in South America. In March 2019, Bannon met with both Bolsonaros in Washington, D.C.In October 2017, after leaving the White House, Bannon met exiled Chinese billionaire businessman Guo Wengui (also known as Miles Kwok), and the pair cultivated a friendship, frequently meeting in Dallas, at Guo's apartment at the Sherry-Netherland in New York, and on Guo's yacht. In 2017, Guo reportedly gave a $150,000 loan to Bannon shortly after he left the White House, and a Guo-linked company entered into a $1 million consulting contract with Bannon, beginning in August 2018. In early 2020, Bannon and Guo raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a private offering for a company called GTV Media Group. In August 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that the fundraising for the company was under investigation of federal and state authorities.Guo has allowed Bannon to use one of his two private jets, and during the 2018 election campaign, Bannon flew on Guo's Bombardier Global Express to events in support of Republican congressional candidates in New Mexico and Arizona. The flights were revealed in February 2020 by ProPublica. Bannon made the flights under the auspices of his dark money group, Citizens of the American Republic. Several campaign finance experts who spoke with ProPublica said the trips could violate federal campaign finance law, which prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions to candidates in U.S. political campaigns (including in-kind contributions such as payment for campaign-related travel). Guo and Bannon denied that the travel was for campaign activity; an attorney for Bannon's group stated that the trips on the private jet were to promote Bannon's film, Trump@War.On June 3, 2020, Bannon and Guo participated in declaring a \"New Federal State of China\" (also called \"Federal State of New China\"). It was said that they would overthrow the Chinese government. In New York City, planes were seen carrying banners which said \"Congratulations to Federal State of New China!\".On August 20, 2020, federal prosecutors in New York unsealed criminal charges against Stephen K. Bannon and three other men they alleged defrauded donors to a massive crowdfunding campaign that said it was raising money for construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. After Bannon's arrest, Guo Wengui hurriedly cut ties with him, stressed that he was not involved in Bannon's affairs outside their shared efforts \"fighting for democracy in China\", and would no longer allow Bannon to continue to serve as a member of Guo Media's board of directors.In November 2020, The New York Times reported that Bannon along with Guo Wengui had been promoting Li-Meng Yan's account of COVID-19. The pair had bought Yan a plane ticket to the United States, provided her accommodation, coached her in media appearances and helped secure interviews with conservative television hosts including Tucker Carlson. Yan later said that the COVID-19 virus was artificially made, however her interview was rejected on social media as misinformation and her research rejected by scientists who said it was \"based on conjecture\" though filled with jargon.",
        "Treatment of colleagues": "In an interview with Frontline, former writer for Breitbart News Ben Shapiro said that he tried to avoid interacting with Bannon due to a fear of being on his bad side. Shapiro also recalled Bannon yelling and cursing at people at Breitbart News. Those who worked with Bannon have described him as \u201cegomaniacal\" and \u201cpurely Machiavellian\u201d. Other former staffers at Breitbart who spoke to Politico said that Bannon would degrade employees by mocking their intelligence and would imply they were \u201cexpendable, low-life creatures\u201d. Several employees who left Breitbart alleged that when they attempted to find employment outside of Breitbart, Bannon attempted to sabotage them. However, other employees praised Bannon's leadership describing him as a generous, loyal, caring, and supportive. Many described Bannon as someone who would pay out of his own pocket for personal expenses.In his memoir, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner recalled having an abrasive relationship with Bannon and two occasions in which Bannon threatened him, including one in which he threatened to 'break Kushner in half' after he accused Bannon of leaking to the press. Also in his memoir Kushner writes \u201cBannon single-handedly caused more problems for me than anyone else in my time in Washington. He probably leaked and lied about me more than everyone else combined. He played dirty and dragged me into the mud of the Russia investigation\".",
        "Connection to Jeffrey Epstein": "According to Michael Wolff, Bannon was introduced to Epstein in 2017 and Epstein introduced Bannon to some of his friends. In August 2018, the New York Post alleged that Bannon was then trying to restore Epstein's favor for financial gain after Bannon met with Epstein at his mansion in New York. Bannon also worked with Ehud Barak and attorney Reid Weingarten to attempt to reform Epstein's public image. Later reports showed Bannon reportedly prepped Epstein for an interview with 60 minutes that ultimately never occurred. Bannon confirmed that he did tape 15 hours of interviews with Epstein, though denied that he was coaching him for further interviews and that the footage was for an unannounced documentary on Epstein.",
        "Criminal prosecutions": "No information",
        "Dismissed 1996 domestic violence charges": "Bannon was charged with misdemeanor domestic violence, battery, and dissuading a witness in early January 1996 after his then-wife, Mary Piccard, accused Bannon of domestic abuse. The Santa Monica Police Department crime report states that after Piccard called 911, an officer arrived at their home and observed red marks on Piccard's wrist and neck. The charges were later dropped when Piccard did not appear in court. In her divorce filing, Piccard stated her absence was due to threats made against her by Bannon and his lawyer: Bannon, she said, told her that \"if I went to court, he and his attorney would make sure that I would be the one who was guilty.\" She said that Bannon's lawyer also threatened her,\" telling her that if Mr. Bannon went to jail, she \"would have no money and no way to support the children.\" Bannon's lawyer denied pressuring Piccard not to testify.",
        "Charges related to \"We Build the Wall\" campaign": "No information",
        "2020 federal fraud and money laundering indictment": "On August 20, 2020, a federal grand jury indictment was unsealed against Bannon and three others, charging them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Each charge has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison upon conviction. Federal prosecutors of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York allege that Bannon, United States Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage and the two other defendants used funds received from the We Build the Wall fundraising campaign, marketed to support the building of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, in a way which was \"inconsistent\" with how they were advertised for use to the public. According to the indictment, donations were collected through a GoFundMe campaign that was launched in December 2018. Bannon promoted the project until the day before the indictment, saying \"You've been the leader of this, assisting President Trump in building this wall in these tough areas\" in his War Room: Pandemic podcast.Federal prosecutors allege that Bannon and the three other men conspired to use a non-profit group run by Bannon, and a shell company controlled by one of the other defendants, to make payments to themselves, despite promises to donors that their contributions would go to build a wall. Prosecutors also alleged that Bannon received more than $1 million in connection with the plan, some of which was paid to Kolfage in secret and some of which Bannon and two other defendants allegedly used for personal expenses ranging from paying off credit cards to personal travel. Prosecutors stated that they plan to seize the assets of Bannon's non-profit Citizens of the American Republic, as well as other organizations \"politically aligned with [Donald] Trump\".Bannon was arrested by U.S. postal inspectors on Long Island Sound, off the coast of Connecticut, on board People's Republic of China expatriate Guo Wengui's luxury yacht. Later that day, Bannon pleaded not guilty to the charges. Bannon was released pending trial on a $5 million bond, of which Bannon was required to put up $1.7 million. He was required to surrender his passport and his domestic travel was restricted. Following the indictment, Donald Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr. distanced themselves from Bannon. Trump Jr. had originally been supportive of Bannon's fundraising efforts for the Trump wall.\nAt a preliminary hearing on August 31, U.S. district judge Analisa Torres set a trial date for May 24, 2021. Prosecutors revealed that they had collected a large number of emails found on various devices and online storage accounts after search warrants were executed\u2014some earlier in the year.",
        "Pardon by Trump": "On January 20, 2021, Trump pardoned Bannon, part of a spate of pardons Trump issued on his last day in office.In May 2021, Judge Torres, following the precedent of criminal cases being dismissed following presidential pardons, dismissed the fraud case against Bannon. Torres said that because the pardon was valid, dismissal of the indictment was \"the proper course.\" In her ruling, Torres stated that despite Bannon not pleading guilty, \"the issuance of a pardon may carry an imputation of guilt; acceptance a confession of it.\" She further quoted: \"If there be no guilt, there is no ground for forgiveness.\"",
        "2022 New York state indictment": "Federal pardons only cover federal offenses, so Trump's pardon of Bannon did not preclude state charges against him. By February 2021, the Manhattan district attorney had issued subpoenas to Wells Fargo Bank and GoFundMe, which had provided accounts for the venture, signaling that a criminal investigation on state charges was advancing. In August 2022, Bannon was indicted on New York state charges of money laundering, conspiracy and fraud related to the $25 million \"We Build The Wall\" scheme. Bannon claimed the charges were politically motivated, and\u2014invoking a common right-wing conspiracy theory\u2014somehow linked the charges to financier George Soros. Bannon said that he and Trump would not \"stop fighting\" and that \"they will have to kill me first\". He surrendered to authorities on September 8.",
        "2022 Contempt of Congress conviction": "On September 23, 2021, the U.S. House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack subpoenaed Bannon, ordering him to appear on October 14. His lawyers gave the committee advance notice that he would not comply. After he did not appear, the House of Representatives voted to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress and to refer him to the Justice Department. This was initiated by the nine-member Committee's unanimous vote on October 19, followed by the full House of Representatives which voted 229\u2013202, with all 220 Democrats and 9 Republicans in favor of the resolution, on October 21. He was indicted by a federal grand jury on November 12, 2021, on two criminal contempt charges: one count of not providing documents, one count of not testifying. Three days later, Bannon surrendered to the FBI. He was represented by criminal defense attorney David Schoen.Bannon was released pending trial, without bail, but on conditions, including keeping authorities informed of his whereabouts, and not leaving the country. He pleaded not guilty. An appeals court in April 2022 rejected his appeal regarding his failure to testify before the committee.In the days leading up to his trial, Bannon offered to testify before the January 6 committee after all; U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, a Trump appointee, rejected Bannon's offer as a \"last-ditch attempt to avoid accountability.\" Bannon sought to delay his trial to October, citing negative publicity from the concurrent televised committee hearings; the court denied the motions. Bannon incorrectly asserted Trump had claimed executive privilege over his testimony and documents He said he would call prominent Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi to testify at his trial, asserting on his podcast, \"we're going medieval on these people.\" Nichols denied the defense motions, finding that Bannon was not entitled to raise an \"advice of counsel\" defense or an executive privilege defense. After the judge's ruling, Bannon's attorney Schoen asked the court, \"what's the point of going to trial if there are no defenses?\", to which Nichols replied, \"agreed,\" hinting that Bannon should seek a plea deal.The trial began on July 18, 2022, with the jury being finalized the next day. Bannon declined to call witnesses or testify in his own defense.On July 22, 2022, the jury found Bannon guilty on both charges. Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney, the chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the January 6 Committee, called Bannon's conviction \"a victory for the rule of law and an important affirmation of the Select Committee's work.\" The U.S. Department of Justice prosecutor said that Bannon \"chose allegiance to Donald Trump over compliance with the law\" and that \"No one is above the law\"; prosecutors also said that  Bannon had \"thumbed his nose\" at American democracy and law.On October 21, 2022, Judge Nichols sentenced Bannon to serve four months in prison and pay a $6,500 fine. Nichol rejected an array of arguments offered by Bannon, including that he was protected by executive privilege from being compelled to testify, and stated in issuing the sentence that \"Others must be deterred from committing similar crimes.\" The U.S. Department of Justice had requested the maximum penalty (six months in jail), plus a $200,000 fine. On November 4, 2022, Bannon appealed his conviction and sentence; he remained free pending appeal, with his sentence being put on hold.",
        "Social media bans": "During the November 5, 2020, edition of his webcast, Bannon called for the beheadings of Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious diseases expert, and FBI director Christopher Wray. Bannon said that if it were up to him, after beheading Fauci and Wray, \"I'd put the heads on pikes\" and display them outside the White House \"as a warning to bureaucrats\" who dared oppose Trump. By the end of the day, Facebook and YouTube had deleted the video from their platforms, and Twitter had permanently banned his account for glorifying violence. Mailchimp also disabled Bannon's email newsletter. The next day, Bannon was dropped by a lawyer who had been defending him against federal charges of fraud.On January 9, 2021, Rudy Giuliani appeared on War Room, accusing Democrats of stealing the recent presidential election and blaming them for the storming of the Capitol. Hours later, YouTube removed both the podcast channel and another one called \"Trump at War \u2013 A Film by Stephen K. Bannon\", citing a \"violation of YouTube's Terms of Service.\"",
        "Political ideology": "Bannon is a Reaganite and has described himself as a populist.In an interview, Bannon told journalist Michael Lewis in February 2018, \"We got elected on Drain the Swamp, Lock Her Up, Build a Wall. This was pure anger. Anger and fear is what gets people to the polls.\" He added, \"The Democrats don't matter. The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.\"According to The Guardian in January 2018, Bannon's ideology is substantially similar to that of Stephen Miller, Tucker Carlson, Benny Johnson, Raheem Kassam and Matthew Boyle, the latter two having been prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Bannon at Breitbart.",
        "Individual issues": "A self-described economic nationalist, Bannon advocates for reductions in immigration and restrictions on free trade with China and Mexico. He has referred to himself as a \"proud Christian Zionist\" in reference to his support of Israel. He has been described as a white nationalist, but rejects the description. He generally believes in reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy, declaring at the Conservative Political Action Conference he favored the \"deconstruction of the administrative state\".",
        "Paris climate agreement": "Bannon was a strong opponent of the Paris climate agreement during his time in the Trump administration, he successfully persuaded Donald Trump to withdraw from it.",
        "Immigration": "Bannon favors reducing immigration, both legal and illegal immigration, to the U.S. and asserts that immigration threatens national sovereignty. Bannon has suggested that too many Silicon Valley chief executives are Asian or South Asian, and that this undermines \"civic society.\" In a 2015 radio appearance, Bannon expressed opposition to resettling any refugees of the Syrian Civil War in the U.S. In a 2016 radio appearance, Bannon asserted that illegal immigration was \"horrific\" but that legal immigration was \"the beating heart of this problem\"; that levels of legal immigration to the U.S. were \"scary\"; and that legal immigrants had \"kinda overwhelmed the country.\"Bannon is the chairman of We Build The Wall, an organization involved in the construction of the proposed expansion of Mexico\u2013United States barrier.",
        "Economics": "Bannon often describes himself as an economic nationalist, criticizing crony capitalism, Austrian economics, and the objectivist capitalism of Ayn Rand. He also generally considers himself a free-market capitalist. Bannon favors raising federal income taxes to 44 percent for those earning incomes over $5 million a year as a way to pay for middle class tax cuts. He also supports significantly increasing spending on infrastructure, describing himself as \"the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan\".In 2014, during a conference at the Vatican, Bannon criticized Wall Street for its role in the 2008 financial crisis. He has also criticized bail outs for big banks and is angered by the fact that Wall Street banks have not been held accountable for the financial crisis, which he says fueled populist fury and groups such as the Tea Party.",
        "Foreign policy": "He is generally skeptical of military intervention abroad, opposing proposals for the expansion of U.S. involvement in the War in Afghanistan, the Syrian Civil War, and the crisis in Venezuela.In Afghanistan, he supported a proposal by Erik Prince for the deployment of private military contractors instead of the U.S. military. He believes \"there is no military solution\" to the 2017 North Korea crisis.Bannon has described U.S. allies in Europe, the Persian Gulf, the South China Sea, the Strait of Malacca, as well as South Korea and Japan, as having become \"protectorates of the United States\" that do not \"make an effort to defend [themselves]\", and believes NATO members should pay a minimum of 2% of GDP on defense.Bannon opposes upgrading the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Bannon strongly favors U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, and was supportive of the approach taken by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis.During his tenure as White House Chief Strategist, Bannon opposed the 2017 Shayrat missile strike, but lost the internal debate on the matter to Kushner. He also expressed skepticism about the 2020 assassination of Qasem Soleimani, questioning whether it was \"necessary to kill this guy and to kill him now and to exacerbate the military issues\", and warned that an escalation with Iran could undermine Trump's support with \"working-class, middle-class people, particularly people whose sons and daughters actually fight in these wars.\"He has referred to himself as a \"proud Christian Zionist\" in reference to his support of Israel. Bannon reportedly spoke often with Trump donor Sheldon Adelson, and was alarmed at a push for a renewed Middle East peace process. He has described Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas as a \"terrorist\". He has advocated giving the land in the West Bank to Jordan and in Gaza to Egypt.",
        "United Kingdom": "Although \"those who met him say\" Bannon initially favored the British National Party (BNP) and the English Defence League (EDL) in the United Kingdom, he later backed the UK Independence Party (UKIP).Bannon urged Boris Johnson, who Bannon said in July 2018 that he had known \"over the last year\" and was \"very impressed\" with, to challenge Prime Minister Theresa May. According to a BuzzFeed News report, Bannon was in private contact with Johnson during his visit to Britain that month, and the two men were previously in text communication during their respective tenures as White House Chief Strategist and British Foreign Secretary.",
        "Europe": "Bannon has defended Trump's ties to and praise for Russian president Vladimir Putin. He expressed a belief that traditionalists see Russia as an ally. Bannon said they \"believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying to do it in a form of nationalism\u2014and I think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country. They want to see nationalism for their country\" rather than a \"pan-European Union\". According to the book War for Eternity, Bannon met notorious Russian ideologue Aleksandr Dugin in Rome in 2018 to advocate closer relations between the United States and Russia, as well as Traditionalist philosophy.In 2018, Bannon announced plans to launch a new political operation beginning with an attempt to unite populist parties across Europe before the 2019 European Parliament election. With the project to be based in Brussels, he indicated he would spend 50 percent of his time in Europe from the following November working at locations throughout the continent. Later that year, Bannon formed a foundation called The Movement to connect far-right groups throughout Europe.Bannon is supportive of European right-wing populist national conservative movements such as the Hungarian Fidesz, the French National Front (now National Rally), the Spanish Vox, the Dutch Party for Freedom, Alternative for Germany, the Italian Northern League, the Freedom Party of Austria, the Sweden Democrats, the Danish People's Party, the Flemish Vlaams Belang and the New Flemish Alliance, the Polish Law and Justice, and the Swiss People's Party.",
        "Islam": "In 2010, Bannon said \"Islam is not a religion of peace. Islam is a religion of submission\". He also criticized George W. Bush for calling Islam a religion of peace. Bannon has said that \"Islam\" today is \"something much darker\" than Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. He has also stated, \"If you're Sharia-compliant ... we don't want you here,\" and has accused U.S. newspapers of being \"Sharia-compliant.\" He has also stated, \"The elites in Europe ... are allowing an Islamic invasion to take place.\"In his talk delivered to a small conference in the Vatican during 2014, Bannon said: \"If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places...it bequeathed to us the great institution that is the church of the West\". He is reputed to believe Putin's Russia and Trump's America are Christian allies against the Islamic State and \"radical Islamic terrorism\". During Bannon's time in the Trump administration Bannon and Stephen Miller helped orchestrate Executive Order 13769 which banned entrance into United States from seven majority Muslim countries. Bannon has been linked to the counter-jihad movement.",
        "Overview and influences": "Bannon's ideology was the subject of the book War for Eternity by Benjamin R. Teitelbaum, where his thinking is described as combining elements of a radical version of the Traditionalist school with paleoconservatism and other more standard American conservative beliefs. Bannon's political and economic views have been described by others as nationalist, and right-wing populist. He self-identifies as a conservative. He rejects allegations that he is a white nationalist.At a party congress in March 2018, Bannon gave members of the French right-wing populist National Front (NF) what has been described as a \"populist pep talk\". He advised party members to \"Let them call you racist, let them call you xenophobes, let them call you nativists. Wear it like a badge of honor. Because every day, we get stronger and they get weaker...History is on our side and will bring us victory.\" Bannon's remarks brought the members to their feet. Critics expressed concern that Bannon was \"normalizing racism.\"Bannon was influenced by Fourth Turning theory, outlined in Neil Howe's and William Strauss's The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy, one of Bannon's favorite books. The theory proposes that \"populism, nationalism and state-run authoritarianism would soon be on the rise, not just in America but around the world. [...Once one strips] away the extraneous accidents and technology, you are left with only a limited number of social moods, which tend to recur in a fixed order\" and cyclically. The book was major influence on Bannon's film Generation Zero.Bannon's political beliefs have been influenced by Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non's traditionalism, a form of anti-modernist thought that views \"certain ancient religions, including the Hindu Vedanta, Sufism, and medieval Catholicism\" as being repositories of spiritual truth under attack by Western secularism; he synthesizes traditionalist beliefs with Catholic social doctrine, particularly the idea of subsidiarity, as expressed in the 1931 papal encyclical, Quadragesimo anno, defending that political matters ought to be handled by the lowest, least centralized competent authority. According to Bannon's former friends, he was particularly influenced by the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita and the ancient Chinese military treatise The Art of War. Bannon has also cited the Russian neo-fascist Alexander Dugin, who promotes a Russian nationalist variant of traditionalism called Eurasianism, and described himself as a fan of Dugin's book, The Fourth Political Theory. However, Bannon has urged Dugin to abandon his anti-American and Sinophile views. Bannon has also described Brazilian traditionalist thinker Olavo de Carvalho as \"one of the great conservative intellectuals in the world\".Lebanese-American author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, neoreactionary blogger Curtis Yarvin and conservative intellectual Michael Anton have been pointed out as three of the main influences in Steve Bannon's political thinking. Bannon is an admirer of paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan. Bannon's favorite columnist is academic Walter Russell Mead. Political theorist and philosopher Edmund Burke has also been described as a major influence on Bannon's ideological outlook. In a 2014 speech to a Vatican conference, Bannon made a passing reference to Julius Evola, a twentieth-century, Nazi-linked Italian writer who influenced Benito Mussolini's Italian Fascism and promoted the Traditionalist School, described by a New York Times writer as \"a worldview popular in far-right and alternative religious circles that believes progress and equality are poisonous illusions.\" Bannon's interest in the ideas of the Traditionalist School was driven by Evola's book Revolt Against the Modern World, and Gu\u00e9non's books Man and His Becoming According to the Vedanta and The Crisis of the Modern World.Green, 2017, page 206. In March 2016, Bannon stated he appreciates \"any piece that mentions Evola.\" In referring to the associated views of Vladimir Putin, who is influenced by Evola follower Dugin, Bannon stated \"We, the Judeo-Christian West, really have to look at what he's talking about as far as Traditionalism goes \u2014 particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism.\" He has likewise quoted French anti-Enlightenment writer Charles Maurras approvingly to a French diplomat. Bannon has also repeatedly referenced the controversial French novel The Camp of the Saints (1973) by Jean Raspail, which depicts Third World immigration destroying Western civilization. He has embraced what BBC News describes as Savitri Devi's \"account of history as a cyclical battle between good and evil\". Bannon told an interviewer in 2018 that he is \"fascinated by Mussolini\", noting: \"He was clearly loved by women. He was a guy's guy. He has all that virility. He also had amazing fashion sense, right, that whole thing with the uniforms.\" A former Breitbart writer wrote that Bannon said in 2015 that alt-right publication American Renaissance was \"fighting the same fight\" as him. Bannon has expressed admiration for German Conservative Revolutionary philosopher Martin Heidegger, praising his \"ideas on the subject of being\".German film director Leni Riefenstahl, who produced propaganda films for the regime in Nazi Germany, is said to have influenced Bannon's film-making techniques, with Bannon once describing himself to writing colleague Julia Jones as the \"Riefenstahl of George Bush\", modifying the ending as \"the GOP\" when Jones was horrified. The opening of Bannon's documentary film The Hope & The Change (2012) consciously imitated Riefenstahl's film The Triumph of the Will (1935), which depicted the Nuremberg Rally held in 1934.",
        "Personal life": "Bannon has been married and divorced three times. He has three adult daughters. His first marriage was to Cathleen Suzanne Houff. Bannon and Houff had a daughter, Maureen, in 1988 and subsequently divorced.Bannon's second marriage was to Mary Louise Piccard, a former investment banker, in April 1995. Their twin daughters were born three days after the wedding. Piccard filed for dissolution of their marriage in 1997.During their divorce proceedings, Piccard alleged that Bannon had made antisemitic remarks about her choice of schools, saying he did not want to send his children to The Archer School for Girls because there were too many Jews at the school, and Jews raise their children to be \"whiny brats.\" Bannon's spokesperson denied the accusation, noting that he had chosen to send both his children to the Archer School.Bannon's third marriage was to model Diane Clohesy; they married in 2006 and divorced in 2009.His brother Chris Bannon is a TV producer.",

    "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso": {
        "Introduction": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso (Portuguese: [\u0292u\u02c8z\u025b m\u0250\u02c8nw\u025bl du\u02c8\u027e\u0250\u0303w b\u0250\u02c8\u0281ozu]; born 23 March 1956) is a Portuguese politician and university teacher, currently serving as non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs International. He previously served as the 11th president of the European Commission and the 115th prime minister of Portugal.",
        "Academic career": "Dur\u00e3o Barroso (as he is known in Portugal) graduated in law from the Faculty of Law of the University of Lisbon. He subsequently obtained a Diploma in European Studies from the European University Institute, and received a MA degree with honours in both Political Science and Social Sciences from the University of Geneva in Switzerland. His academic career continued as an assistant professor in the Faculty of Law of the University of Lisbon. Barroso did PhD research at Georgetown University and Georgetown's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C., but his CV does not list any doctoral degree (except honorary). He is a 1998 graduate of the Georgetown Leadership Seminar. Back in Lisbon, Barroso became director of the Department for International Relations at Lus\u00edada University (Universidade Lus\u00edada).\nBarroso is now a policy fellow at the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination at Princeton University and the Frederick H. Schultz Class of 1951 Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs Woodrow Wilson School, where he teaches with Wolfgang F. Danspeckgruber on the EU in International Affairs. Barroso also teaches at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies and at the University of Geneva.\nAt Cat\u00f3lica Global School of Law, he has taught the seminar on \"The Dynamics of European Union Institutions\" since 2015, on two LL.M. programmes.",
        "Early political career": "Barroso's political activity began in his late teens, during the Estado Novo regime in Portugal, before the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974. In his university days, he was one of the leaders of the underground Maoist MRPP (Re-Organized Movement of the Proletariat Party, later Portuguese Workers' Communist Party (PCTP/MRPP), Communist Party of the Portuguese Workers/Revolutionary Movement of the Portuguese Proletariat). In an interview with the newspaper Expresso, he said that he had joined MRPP to fight the only other student body movement, also underground, which was controlled by the Portuguese Communist Party. Despite this justification, there is a very famous political 1976 interview recorded by the Portuguese state-run television channel, RTP, in which Barroso, as a politically minded student during the post-Carnation Revolution turmoil known as PREC, criticises the bourgeois education system which \"throws students against workers and workers against students.\" In December 1980, Barroso joined the right-of-centre PPD (Democratic Popular Party, later PPD/PSD-Social Democratic Party), where he remains to the present day.\nIn 1985, under the PSD government of An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, 113th prime minister of Portugal, Barroso was named Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs. In 1987 he became a member of the same government as he was elevated to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (answering to the Minister of Foreign Affairs), a post he was to hold for the next five years. In this capacity, he was the driving force behind the Bicesse Accords of 1990, which led to a temporary armistice in the Angolan Civil War between the ruling MPLA and the opposition UNITA. He also supported independence for East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, then a province of Indonesia by force. In 1992, Barroso was promoted to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, and served in this capacity until the defeat of the PSD in the 1995 general election.",
        "Prime minister of Portugal": "While in opposition, Barroso was elected to the Assembly of the Republic in 1995 as a representative for Lisbon. There, he became chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1999 he was elected president of his political party, PSD, succeeding Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa (a professor of law), and thus became Leader of the Opposition. Parliamentary elections in 2002 gave the PSD enough seats to form a coalition government with the right-wing Portuguese People's Party, and Barroso subsequently became Prime Minister of Portugal on 6 April 2002.\nAs prime minister, facing a growing budget deficit, he made a number of difficult decisions and adopted strict reforms. He vowed to reduce public expenditure, which made him unpopular among leftists and public servants.. His purpose was to lower the public budget deficit to a 3% target (according to the demands of EU rules), and official data during the 2002\u20132004 period stated that the target was being attained.\n\nIn March 2003, Barroso hosted U.S President George W. Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar in the Portuguese island of Terceira, in the Azores. The four leaders finalised the controversial US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Under Barroso's leadership, Portugal became part of the \"coalition of the willing\" for the invasion and occupation of Iraq, sending non-combat troops. On 30 January 2003, Barroso signed The letter of the eight supporting US. policy on Iraq.Barroso did not finish his term as he had been nominated as president of the European Commission on 5 July 2004. Barroso arranged with Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio to nominate Pedro Santana Lopes as a substitute prime minister of Portugal. Santana Lopes led the PSD/PP coalition for a few months until early 2005, when new elections were called. When the Portuguese Socialist Party won the elections it produced an estimation that by the end of the year the budget deficit would reach 6.1%, which it used to criticise Barroso's and Santana Lopes's economic policies.",
        "President of the European Commission": "In 2004, the proposed European Constitution and now the Treaty of Lisbon included a provision that the choice of president must take into account the result of Parliamentary elections and the candidate supported by the victorious Europarty in particular. That provision was not in force in the nomination in 2004, but the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), who won the elections, pressured for a candidate from its own ranks. In the end, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the EPP candidate, was chosen by the European Council.On the same basis, the EPP again endorsed Barroso for a second term during the 2009 European election campaign and, after the EPP again won the elections, was able to secure his nomination by the European Council on 17 June 2009. On 3 September 2009, Barroso unveiled his manifesto for his second term. On 16 September 2009, Barroso was re-elected by the European Parliament for another five years. Since he completed his second term he became only the second Commission president to serve two terms, after Jacques Delors. That Commission's term of office ran until 31 October 2014.During his first presidency, the following important issues were on the Commission's agenda:\n\nTurkey applying for EU membership\nThe reform of the institutions (Treaty of Lisbon)\nThe Bolkestein directive, aimed at creating a single market for services within the EU\nLisbon Strategy\nGalileo positioning system\nDoha Development Agenda negotiations\nEuropean Institute of Innovation and Technology\nAn EU climate change packageOne of his first tasks since being re-elected was a visit to Ireland to persuade Irish citizens to approve the Treaty of Lisbon in the country's second referendum due to be held the following month. Barroso was greeted by Irish Minister for Defence Willie O'Dea and Peter Power, the Minister of State for Overseas Development, as he got off his plane at Shannon Airport on the morning of 19 September 2009 before briefly meeting with the joint committee of the Oireachtas and meeting and greeting people at functions in Limerick's City Hall, University of Limerick (UL) and the Savoy Hotel. He told The Irish Times in an interview referenced internationally by Reuters that he had been asked if Ireland would split from the European Union. He also launched a \u20ac14.8 million grant for former workers at Dell's Limerick plant, described as \"conveniently opportune\" by former Member of the European Parliament and anti-Lisbonite Patricia McKenna.On 12 September 2012 Barroso has called for the EU to evolve into a \"federation of nation-states\". Addressing the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Barroso said such a move was necessary to combat the continent's economic crisis. He said he believed Greece would be able to stay in the eurozone if it stood by its commitments. Mr Barroso also set out plans for a single supervisory mechanism for all banks in the eurozone.\n\nHe was once appointed Acting Commissioner for Inter-Institutional Relations and Administration in Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d's stead, from 19 April 2014 \u2013 25 May 2014 while he was on electoral campaign leave for the 2014 elections to the European Parliament. He ultimately decided to not take up his seat.",
        "Controversies": "In 2005, Die Welt reported that Barroso had spent a week on the yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire Spiro Latsis. It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred only a month before the Commission approved 10 million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis's shipping company \u2013 though the state aid decision had been taken by the previous European Commission before Barroso took up his post. In response to this revelation, Nigel Farage MEP of the UK Independence Party persuaded around 75 MEPs from across the political spectrum to back a motion of no confidence in Barroso, so as to compel him to appear before the European Parliament to be questioned on the matter. The motion was tabled on 12 May 2005, and Barroso appeared before Parliament as required at a debate on 26 May 2005. The motion itself was heavily defeated.\nIn response to criticism for his choice of a less fuel efficient Volkswagen Touareg, amid EU legislation of targets drastically to reduce car CO2 emissions, Barroso dismissed this as \"overzealous moralism\".In April 2008, amid sharp food price rises and mounting food vs fuel concerns, Barroso insisted that biofuel use was \"not significant\" in pushing up food prices. The following month, he announced a study that would look into the issue. The backdoor approval of the GE potato, by President Barroso, has met a wave of strong opposition from EU member-states. The governments of Greece, Austria, Luxembourg, Italy, Hungary and France have all publicly announced that they will not allow the GE potato to be grown in their countries.\nBarroso has expressed criticism of national governments arguing \"Decisions taken by the most democratic institutions in the world are very often wrong.\"In December 2013 Barroso said that Europe was not the cause of the problems for Ireland; Ireland caused a problem for Europe. Following the bailout exit, in December 2013, the Irish government's bid to get backdated funding for the banking sector was rejected as the head of the European Commission blamed the Irish banks, regulators and government for the difficulties in the country. Barroso said the problems in the Irish banks caused a \"major destabilisation\" in the euro, rather than structural problems with the currency itself, \"I am saying this because it would be wrong to give the impression that Europe has created a problem for Ireland and now Europe has to help Ireland. In fact, it was the banking sector in Ireland\u2014it was one of the biggest problems in the world in terms of banking stability what happened in Ireland.\"Barroso was heavily criticised for taking a position as a chairman and senior adviser to the international arm of Goldman Sachs. He did so two months after the 18-month \"cooling-off\" period for EU officials after they leave their posts. Barroso's move was especially sensitive because Goldman Sachs is an American institution that played a questionable role in the financial crisis that nearly broke the euro. Furthermore, Barroso announced his move to the London-based subsidiary of Goldman Sachs shortly after the Brexit referendum. The European Commission agreed to an unprecedented ethics inquiry into the move. The independent panel concluded there were \"not sufficient grounds to establish a violation of the duty of integrity and discretion\" and accepted Barroso's assurances that he would not be lobbying on behalf of the bank's clients.",
        "Other activities": "In July 2016, Barroso became the non-executive chairman of London-based Goldman Sachs International (GSI), the bank's largest subsidiary. He is also an adviser to the bank. At the time of his appointments, this position was regarded as quite controversial, and later led Barroso's successor Jean-Claude Juncker to launch an ethics investigation.In 2020, Barroso was selected as chair of the board at GAVI, succeeding Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.In addition, Barroso has held several paid and unpaid positions, including:\n\nInternational Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity (led by Gordon Brown), Member (since 2015)\nBilderberg Meetings, Member of the Steering Committee (since 2014)\nChatham House, Member of the Panel of Senior Advisers\nEuropean Business Summit (EBS), Honorary Chairman of the Honorary Committee (since 2014)\nEuropaeum, Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2014)\nEuropean Movement International, Member of the Honorary Council\nKofi Annan Foundation, Member of the Electoral Integrity Initiative (EII) (since 2016)\nLindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, Member of the Honorary Senate\nWomen Political Leaders Global Forum (WPL), Member of the Global Advisory Board\nSunhak Peace Prize Selection Committee, chair.UEFA Foundation for Children, Member of the Board of Trustees (2014-2017)",
        "Personal life": "Barroso is the son of Lu\u00eds Ant\u00f3nio Saraiva Barroso and his wife Maria Elisabete de Freitas Dur\u00e3o. In 1980 he married Maria Margarida Pinto Ribeiro de Sousa Uva, with whom he has three sons. Sousa Uva died from uterine cancer in August 2016, at the age of 60.\nApart from Portuguese, Barroso is fluent in French, speaks Spanish and English and has taken a course to acquire a basic knowledge of German.",

He owned more than half of the shares, but was a passive investor and not involved in the day-to-day business. British research platform Tortoise Media and Austrian magazine Dossier cooperated on an investigation.Company records showed Bergemar lived in China, but was found to be actually living in a mansion in London after the investigation by Tortoise Media. Soon after, his Brazilian wife Priscila Bergmair told The Sunday Times that she wanted her husband to cut ties with the company."

    "Fischer Black": {
        "Introduction": "Fischer Sheffey Black (January 11, 1938 \u2013 August 30, 1995) was an American economist, best known as one of the authors of the Black\u2013Scholes equation.",
        "Background": "Fischer Sheffey Black was born on January 11, 1938. He graduated from Harvard College in 1959 and received a PhD in applied mathematics from Harvard University in 1964. He was initially expelled from the PhD program due to his inability to settle on a thesis topic, having switched from physics to mathematics, then to computers and artificial intelligence. Black joined the consultancy Bolt, Beranek and Newman, working on a system for artificial intelligence. He spent a summer developing his ideas at the RAND corporation. He became a student of  MIT professor Marvin Minsky, and was later able to submit his research for completion of the Harvard PhD.\nBlack joined Arthur D. Little, where he was first exposed to economic and financial consulting and where he met his future collaborator Jack Treynor. In 1971, he began to work at the University of Chicago.  He later left the University of Chicago in 1975 to work at the MIT Sloan School of Management.  In 1984, he joined Goldman Sachs where he worked until death.",
        "Economic career": "Black began thinking seriously about monetary policy around 1970 and found, at this time, that the big debate in this field was between Keynesians and monetarists. The Keynesians (under the leadership of Franco Modigliani) believe there is a natural tendency of the credit markets toward instability, toward boom and bust, and they assign to both monetary and fiscal policy roles in damping down this cycle, working toward the goal of smooth sustainable growth.  In the Keynesian view, central bankers have to have discretionary powers to fulfill their role properly.  Monetarists, under the leadership of Milton Friedman, believe that discretionary central banking is the problem, not the solution.  Friedman believed that the growth of the money supply could and should be set at a constant rate, say 3% a year, to accommodate predictable growth in real GDP.\nOn the basis of the capital asset pricing model, Black concluded that discretionary monetary policy could not do the good that Keynesians wanted it to do. He concluded that monetary policy should be passive within an economy. But he also concluded that it could not do the harm monetarists feared it would do.  Black said in a letter to Friedman, in January 1972:\n\nIn the U.S. economy, much of the public debt is in the form of Treasury bills. Each week, some of these bills mature, and new bills are sold. If the Federal Reserve System tries to inject money into the private sector, the private sector will simply turn around and exchange its money for Treasury bills at the next auction. If the Federal Reserve withdraws money, the private sector will allow some of its Treasury bills to mature without replacing them.\nIn 1973, Black, along with Myron Scholes, published the paper 'The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities' in 'The Journal of Political Economy'. This was his most famous work and included the Black\u2013Scholes equation.\nIn March 1976, Black proposed that human capital and business have \"ups and downs that are largely unpredictable [...] because of basic uncertainty about what people will want in the future and about what the economy will be able to produce in the future. If future tastes and technology were known, profits and wages would grow smoothly and surely over time.\" A boom is a period when technology matches well with demand. A bust is a period of mismatch.  This view made Black an early contributor to real business cycle theory.\nEconomist Tyler Cowen has argued that Black's work on monetary economics and business cycles can be used to explain the Great Recession.\nBlack's works on monetary theory, business cycles and options are parts of his vision of a unified framework. He once stated: I like the beauty and symmetry in Mr. Treynor's equilibrium models so much that I started designing them myself. I worked on models in several areas: Monetary theory, Business cycles, Options and warrantsFor 20 years, I have been struggling to show people the beauty in these models to pass on knowledge I received from Mr. Treynor.In monetary theory --- the theory of how money is related to economic activity --- I am still struggling. In business cycle theory --- the theory of fluctuation in the economy --- I am still struggling. In options and warrants, though, people see the beauty.It can be shown that the mathematical techniques developed in the option theory can be extended to provide a mathematical analysis of monetary theory and business cycles as well.",
        "Business Cycles and Equilibrium (1987)": "Fischer Black has published many academic articles, including his most known book, Business Cycles and Equilibrium. In this book, Black proposes at the beginning of the book to imagine a world where money does not exist. With its theory that economic and financial markets are in a continual equilibrium-is one of his books that still rings true today, given the current economic crisis. Building upon these statements, Black creates models as well as challenges monetary theorists, especially those who subscribe to the ideas of the quantity theory of money and liquidity of money. Banks are the main institutions of monetary transactions in Black's book, to which he also states that money is an endogenous resource (contrary to monetarists who believe money to be an exogenous resource), provided by banks due to profit maximization. Controversial statements such as \"Monetary and exchange rate policies accomplish almost nothing, and fiscal policies are unimportant in causing or changing business cycles\" have made Black enemies with Keynesians and Monetarists alike.",
        "Illness and death": "In early 1994, Black was diagnosed with throat cancer. Surgery at first appeared successful, and Black was well enough to attend the annual meeting of the International Association of Financial Engineers that October, where he received their award as Financial Engineer of the Year. However, the cancer returned, and Black died in August 1995.",
        "Posthumous recognition": "The Nobel Prize is not given posthumously, so it was not awarded to Black in 1997 when his co-author Myron Scholes received the honor for their landmark work on option pricing along with Robert C. Merton, another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options.  However, when announcing the award that year, the Nobel committee did prominently mention Black's key role.\nBlack has also received recognition as the co-author of the Black\u2013Derman\u2013Toy interest rate derivatives model, which was developed for in-house use by Goldman Sachs in the 1980s but eventually published. He also co-authored the Black\u2013Litterman model on global asset allocation while at Goldman Sachs.\nThe Advisory Board of The Journal of Performance Measurement inducted Black into the Performance & Risk Measurement Hall of Fame in 2017. The announcement appears in the Winter 2016/2017 issue of the journal. The Hall of Fame recognizes individuals who have made significant contributions to investment performance and risk measurement.",
        "Fischer Black Prize": "In 2002, the American Finance Association established the biennially awarded Fischer Black Prize in memory of Fischer Black.

While working as an investment-banking analyst, Burnett was offered a position at CNN as a writer and booker for CNN's Moneyline with Stuart Varney, Willow Bay, and Lou Dobbs. She left the position to serve as vice president of Citigroup's digital media group, CitiMedia.\n\nFollowing Citigroup, Burnett joined Bloomberg Television as Stocks Editor and anchor. From 2005 to 2011 Burnett was the host of CNBC's Street Signs and co-anchor of Squawk on the Street with Mark Haines.On August 5, 2009, Burnett used the term \"serial killer\" in a discussion with her host Jim Cramer regarding a report about the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's plans to spend millions of dollars on aerial shooting to cull Australian feral camels in the outback. Cramer referred to the reported plan as \"camelcide\". The next day on the show, Burnett said her comment was meant as a joke.On December 7, 2010, Burnett presented an investigative report on chemical giant Transammonia doing business in Iran. She reported that a wholly owned subsidiary of Transammonia in the United States purchased ammonia from Iran. On December 13, 2010, as a result of the CNBC report, Transammonia sent a press release to congressional leaders stating that Transammonia's Swiss subsidiary would not enter into new contracts with Iranian companies and would wind down its business with Iran \"as soon as possible.\" The following year, the investigative report was nominated for an Emmy.Following more than five years with CNBC, Burnett left the network on May 6, 2011, and joined rival news outlet CNN beginning October 3, 2011.

Journalist Glenn Greenwald reacted in a Salon article detailing bias in Burnett's reporting, which he attributed to her previous work experience on Wall Street as well as her partner's employment with Citigroup. In response to the criticism, CNN issued a statement saying, \"We support Erin and the OutFront team and we respect that there will be a range of opinions on any given story.\"Burnett stated that President Trump's proposal under the Insurrection Act to use military forces to remove protestors from Lafayette Square would constitute \"invoking an act not invoked since 1807 to deploy U.S. military troops on American soil.\" She later issued a correction, noting that the act has been invoked previously, the last time in 1992.",

Prior to his governorships, Carney worked at Goldman Sachs as well as the Department of Finance Canada.",
        "Early life": "Carney was born on March 16, 1965, in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, the son of Verlie Margaret (n\u00e9e Kemper) and Robert James Martin Carney.When Carney was six, his family moved to Edmonton, Alberta. Carney has three siblings \u2014 an older brother and sister, Se\u00e1n and Brenda, and a younger brother Brian. Carney attended St. Francis Xavier High School, Edmonton before studying at Harvard University.Carney graduated from Harvard in 1988 with a bachelor's degree with high honours in economics, before postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford at St Peter's College and Nuffield College, where he received masters and doctoral degrees in the same field in 1993 and 1995, respectively. The title of his DPhil thesis is \"The dynamic advantage of competition\".",
        "Career": "No information",
        "Goldman Sachs": "Carney spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs and worked in their Boston, London, New York City, Tokyo, and Toronto offices. His progressively more senior positions included: co-head of sovereign risk; executive director, emerging debt capital markets; and managing director, investment banking. He worked on South Africa's post-apartheid venture into international bond markets, and was involved in Goldman's work with the 1998 Russian financial crisis.In 2003, Carney left Goldman Sachs to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor. One year later, he was recruited to join the Department of Finance Canada as senior associate deputy minister, beginning that role on November 15, 2004.",
        "Department of Finance": "From November 2004 to October 2007, Carney was the senior associate deputy minister and G7 deputy in the Canadian Finance Department. He served under two finance ministers: Ralph Goodale, a Liberal and Jim Flaherty, a Conservative. During this time Carney oversaw the Government of Canada's controversial plan to tax income trusts at source. Carney was also the lead on the federal government's profitable sale of its 19 percent stake in Petro-Canada.",
        "Governor of the Bank of Canada": "In November 2007, it was announced that Carney would be appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada. He immediately left his position at the Department of Finance to serve as an advisor to the outgoing governor, David Dodge, before formally assuming Dodge's position on February 1, 2008. Carney was selected over Paul Jenkins, the senior deputy governor, who had been considered the front-runner to succeed Dodge.Carney took on this role at the beginning of the 2007 global financial crisis. At the time of his appointment, Carney was the youngest central bank governor among the G8 and G20.",
        "Financial crisis": "Carney's actions as Governor of the Bank of Canada are said to have played a major role in helping Canada avoid the worst impacts of the financial crisis.The epoch-making feature of his tenure as Governor remains the decision to cut the overnight rate by 50 basis points in March 2008, only one month after his appointment. While the European Central Bank delivered a rate increase in July 2008, Carney anticipated the leveraged-loan crisis would trigger global contagion. When policy rates in Canada hit the effective lower-bound, the central bank combatted the crisis with the non-standard monetary tool: \"conditional commitment\" in April 2009 to hold the policy rate for at least one year, in a boost to domestic credit conditions and market confidence. Output and employment began to recover from mid-2009, in part thanks to monetary stimulus. The Canadian economy outperformed those of its G7 peers during the crisis, and Canada was the first G7 nation to have both its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employment recover to pre-crisis levels.The Bank of Canada's decision to provide substantial additional liquidity to the Canadian financial system, and its unusual step of announcing a commitment to keep interest rates at their lowest possible level for one year, appear to have been significant contributors to Canada's weathering of the crisis.Canada's risk-averse fiscal and regulatory environment is also cited as a factor. In 2009 a Newsweek columnist wrote, \"Canada has done more than survive this financial crisis. The country is positively thriving in it. Canadian banks are well capitalized and poised to take advantage of opportunities that American and European banks cannot seize.\"Carney earned various accolades for his leadership during the financial crisis: he was named one of Financial Times's \"Fifty who will frame the way forward\", and of Time Magazine's 2010 Time 100. In May 2011, Reader's Digest named him \"Editor's Choice for Most Trusted Canadian\".In October 2012, Carney was named \"Central Bank Governor of the Year 2012\" by the editors of Euromoney magazine.",
        "International organization memberships": "On November 4, 2011, Carney was named Chairman of the Basel-based Financial Stability Board. In a statement, Carney credited his appointment to \"the strong reputation of Canada's financial system and the leading role that Canada has played in helping to develop many of the most important international reforms\".The three-year term was a part-time commitment, allowing Carney to complete his term at the Bank of Canada. While there had been no indication of his priorities as chairman, on the day of his appointment the Board published a list of 29 banks that were considered sufficiently large as to pose a risk to the global economy should they fail. At his first press conference as Chairman of the FSB in January 2012, Carney laid out his key priorities for the board.Carney served as Chairman of the Bank for International Settlements' Committee on the Global Financial System from July 2010 until January 2012.Carney is a member of the Group of Thirty, an international body of leading financiers and academics, and of the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum. Carney attended the annual meetings of the Bilderberg Group in 2011, 2012 and 2019.",
        "Governor of the Bank of England": "On November 26, 2012, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced the appointment of Carney as Governor of the Bank of England. He succeeded Sir Mervyn King on July 1, 2013. He was the first non-Briton to be appointed to the role since the Bank of England was established in 1694. The Bank of England was given additional powers from 2013, such as the ability to set bank capital requirements.Prior to taking up the post, Carney had already indicated disagreement with the Bank of England's Executive Director of Financial Stability Andy Haldane, specifically on leverage ratios and on bank break-ups. He has been quoted as saying that Haldane does not have a \"proper understanding of the facts\" on bank regulation. He was thought to have been offered a total pay package of about \u00a3624,000 ($844,000 USD) per year, approximately \u00a3100,000 ($135,000 USD) more per year than his predecessor.",
        "Since 2020": "Carney was appointed as United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance as he prepared to step down as governor of the Bank of England in March 2020. In January 2020, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson appointed Carney to the position of finance advisor for the UK presidency of the COP26 United Nations Climate Change conference in Glasgow; at that time the conference was scheduled for November 2020 but it was later postponed to November 2021.As of October 2020, Carney is vice chairman at Brookfield Asset Management where he leads the firm's environmental, social and governance (ESG) and impact fund investment strategy. In February 2021, Carney had to retract an earlier claim that the $600 billion Brookfield Asset Management portfolio was carbon neutral. He based his claim on the fact that Brookfield has a large renewable energy portfolio and \"all the avoided emissions that come with that\u201d. The claim was criticized as accounting tricks as avoided emissions do not counteract the emissions from investments in coal and other fossil fuels responsible for Brookfield's carbon footprint of about 5,200 metric tons of carbon dioxide.In February 2021, Carney joined the board of fintech company Stripe. As of March 2021, Stripe was valued at $95 billion.Carney helped launch the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021. He acts as the group's Co-Chair.",
        "Policy views": "No information",
        "Risks of increasing wealth inequality": "In December 2016, Carney warned of the societal risk of \"staggering wealth inequalities\" in a Roscoe Lecture at Liverpool John Moores University: \"The proportion of the wealth held by the richest 1% of Americans increased from 25% in 1990 to 40% in 2012 ... Globally, the share of wealth held by the richest 1% in the world rose from one-third in 2000 to one-half in 2010.\"",
        "Brexit": "Carney warned many times that Brexit was expected to negatively influence the UK economy. Consequently, Brexit activists accused him of making statements favouring the UK's continued membership of the European Union (EU) before the British EU-membership referendum. He replied that he felt it was his duty to speak up on such issues.In September 2018, Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, confirmed speculation that Carney would remain as Governor until January 2020, in order to ensure a \"smooth\" transition after the UK was set to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, a departure deadline that was missed.In November 2018, Carney warned that large parts of the British economy were not ready for a no-deal Brexit. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, Carney explained that fewer than half of businesses have initiated contingency plans.In February 2019, speaking about the global economy, Carney provided a less negative perspective on Brexit, stating that globalisation has resulted in \"imbalances of democracy and sovereignty\", and that Brexit \"is the first test of a new global order and could prove the acid test of whether a way can be found to broaden the benefits of openness while enhancing democratic accountability\".",
        "Monetary policy in the 2019 international monetary and financial system": "In his August 23, 2019, speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's 2019 annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium at Jackson Lake Lodge, entitled \"The Growing Challenges for Monetary Policy in the current International Monetary and Financial System\", Carney said that the \"widespread use of the US dollar\u2014the dominant currency pricing\u2014in \"trade invoicing, in place of the currency of either the producer or the importer\" has had a \"destablilizing\" effect on the global economy, according to Reuters. About 50 percent of international trade relies on the US dollar as the \"currency of choice.\" This represents \"five times greater than the US's share in world goods imports, and three times its share in world exports.\" Dominant currency pricing is not problematic when there is \"synchronised growth\" globally, Carney said. When \"the tide is rising in America while receding elsewhere\", the system needs to be revamped. Carney cited  an article by Markus K. Brunnermeier, Harold James, and Jean-Pierre Landau on the potential role of digital currency area (DCA) in redefining the international monetary system.Speaking only hours after US President Donald Trump had posted on Twitter that he blamed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's policies creating fears of an economic recession\u2014and then threatened China with more retaliatory tariffs\u2014Carney urged central banks to work together to replace the US dollar as reserve currency. He cautioned against choosing another new hegemonic reserve currency like the Renminbi and suggested instead, a \"new Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC), such as Libra, which could potentially be provided \"through a network of central bank digital currencies,\" that would decrease the US dollar's \"domineering influence\" on trade worldwide.Carney also said that the recent increase in the perception that a no-deal Brexit is likely, is \"evidenced by betting odds and financial market asset pricing\" resulting in the UK now having \"the highest FX implied volatility, the highest equity risk premium and lowest real yields of any advanced economy.\"",
        "Climate change": "Carney has taken a leading position on the need for climate action.",
        "Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM)": "In 2020, Carney launched the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets\u2014an initiative to increase trading of voluntary carbon offsets\u2014 with Bill Winters as Group Chief Executive. The TSVCM is sponsored by the Institute of International Finance. Taskforce members include more than \"40 leaders from six continents with backgrounds across the carbon market value chain\", including representatives from the Bank of America, BlackRock, Bloomberg's New Energy Finance, BNP Paribas, BP, Boeing, Goldman Sachs, Tata Steel, Total, IHS Markit, and LSE. In a December 3, 2020 Financial Times article, Carney said that the voluntary global carbon offset market was an \"imperative\" to help reduce emissions. The Times article cited Carney saying London would likely be the host of the new \"new pilot market for voluntary carbon offsets\" which could be \"set up\" by December 2021.",
        "Moral to market sentiments": "On December 2, 2020, Carney delivered the first of four Reith Lectures\u2014the BBC's flagship annual series. In \"How We Get What We Value \u2013 From Moral to Market Sentiments\", he said society had come to esteem financial value over human value and moved from market economies to market societies. The series covers a trio of crises\u2014credit, Covid and climate.",
        "Personal life": "Carney met his wife, Diana Fox, a British economist specializing in developing nations, while at the University of Oxford. She is active in various environmental and social justice causes. The couple married in July 1994 while he was finishing his doctoral thesis. They have four children and lived in Toronto, before moving to the Rockcliffe Park neighbourhood of Ottawa and then moving to London in 2013. They moved back to Ottawa when Mark Carney left his role in the Bank of England.\nDuring his Harvard years, Carney was backup goalie for the school's ice hockey team. Carney continued playing the sport with the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club while studying at Nuffield College, Oxford.Carney completed the 2015 London Marathon in 03:31:22, which was 17 minutes faster than his time at the 2011 Ottawa Marathon.Carney speaks fluent French. In addition to his Canadian citizenship, he also holds Irish (two of his grandparents are from County Mayo) and British citizenship. He has distant relatives in Liverpool and is a supporter of the city's Everton F.C. He is also a supporter of the Edmonton Oilers.\nThere was some controversy with Carney's time running the Bank of England. Staff members compared his temper flare-ups to 'being tasered'.",

        "Introduction": "Waddill Catchings (September 6, 1879 \u2013 December 31, 1967) was an American economist who collaborated with his Harvard classmate William Trufant Foster in a series of economics books that were highly influential in the United States in the 1920s.  His influential books, written with Foster, were Money (1923), Profits (1925), Business Without a Buyer (1927), The Road to Plenty (1928), and Progress and Plenty (1930). The books influenced many policy makers, including Herbert Hoover and Marriner Eccles.  Catchings graduated from Harvard.",
        "Life and career": "He was a leading banker and financier in the 1910s and 1920s, making (and losing) a fortune of over $250 million. By 1931 he had nearly bankrupted his employer, Goldman Sachs, through his formation of the Goldman Sachs Trading Company and its floating of the Shenandoah & Blue Ridge investment trusts, controlled by Harrison Williams.  Catchings was a director of major corporations in diverse fields, including leather, motion pictures (Warner Brothers), radio, television, recorded music (Muzak Holdings), tin cans, dry goods, rubber, pharmaceuticals, automobiles (Studebaker and Chrysler), typewriters, breakfast cereals, lumber, mail-order merchandising, music publishing, and electric power.",
        "Influence": "A superb phrase maker and popularizer, he had a major impact on Franklin D. Roosevelt. For example, Roosevelt's talk of a nation \"one-third ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed\" used one of Catchings' expressions.\nWith Foster, he was one of the leading pre-Keynesian economists, in the underconsumptionist tradition, advocating similar issues to Keynes such as the paradox of thrift and economic interventionism. The two are now rarely mentioned in contemporary economics texts, standing as they do in the shadow of Keynes's The General Theory."

His criticism of the hypothetical tax increase was then used as part of a Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign advertisement.\nDuring the January 2021 GameStop short squeeze, Cooperman appeared on CNBC to discuss the situation, angrily saying it was caused by \"people sitting at home getting checks from the Government\". The checks were part of the United States response to the COVID 19 pandemic.

He went on to serve as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1980 to 1984 and President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1985 until 1993.\nFrom 1991 to 1993 he was Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  From 1993 to 1995 he was director of the Council on Foreign Relations.",
        "Post-Federal Reserve; Goldman Sachs": "Corrigan joined Goldman Sachs in 1994 and has been a partner and managing director in the Office of the Chairman since 1996.  He served as co-chair of both the Risk Committee and the Global Compliance and Controls Committee at Goldman Sachs.  In 1994 Corrigan also joined the influential Washington-based financial advisory body, the Group of Thirty.\nSince 1999, Corrigan has served as Chairman of the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group (CRMPG). The CRMPG is a financial industry policy group designed to promote enhanced strong practices in counterparty credit risk and market risk management. In this capacity Corrigan testified before the Committee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives concerning hedge funds and systematic risk in the financial markets on March 13, 2007.  In concluding his testimony, Corrigan foreshadowed the pending financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 by stating \"[o]ne of the most difficult challenges in human endeavor is how we manage low probability events \u2013 such as financial shocks \u2013 that can cause so much damage. In the financial arena I believe we are making progress in meeting that challenge and we must continue the effort for we know that the future will bring new tests of the stability and resiliency of the financial system.\"In 2005, the Global Association of Risk Professionals awarded their \"Risk Manager of the Year\" designation to Corrigan.In a major article in April, 2009 about Obama Administration Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and his role in the national and global financial crisis, The New York Times writers traced the evolution of the AIG part in the crisis in September, 2008. A.I.G.'s chief executive at the time, Robert B. Willumstad, was seeking help raising capital from JP MorganChase, not using Goldman Sachs because it was \"one of A.I.G.'s biggest trading partners\" and, Mr. Willumstad believed, \"the potential conflicts of interest ... were too great.\" However, on \"Monday, Sept. 15, Mr. Geithner pushed A.I.G. to bring Goldman onto its team to raise capital,\" the article said, quoting Mr. Willumstad. \"Mr. Geithner and Mr. Corrigan ... were close, speaking frequently and sometimes lunching together at Goldman headquarters. On [Sep. 15th], the company's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, was at the New York Fed. A Goldman spokesman [told the Times] 'We don't believe anyone at Goldman Sachs asked Mr. Geithner to include the firm in the assignment.' Mr. Geithner said he had suggested Goldman get involved because the situation was chaotic and 'time was running out,'\" the article concluded relative to Mr. Corrigan's and Goldman's involvements with the then-NY Fed president Geithner.\nThe article went on, though, relative to the episode as a whole, \"A.I.G.'s search for [private] capital was fruitless\" and the Federal Reserve led by Chairman Ben Bernanke and the Treasury led by Secretary Hank Paulson (formerly of Goldman) had to come to the rescue. \"By late Tuesday afternoon [Sep. 16], the government would step in with an $85 billion loan, the first installment of a bailout that now stands at $182 billion. As part of the bailout, A.I.G.'s trading partners, including Goldman, were compensated fully for money owed to them by A.I.G. Analysts say the New York Fed should have pressed A.I.G.'s trading partners to take a deep discount on what they were owed. But Mr. Geithner said he had no bargaining power because he was unwilling to threaten A.I.G.'s trading partners with a bankruptcy by the insurer for fear of further destabilizing the system. A recent report on the A.I.G. bailout by the Government Accountability Office found that taxpayers may never get their money back.\"In February, 2010, Corrigan faced inquiry in the House of Commons Treasury committee in London, England for Goldman's involvement with currency swaps executed with the Greek government. The swaps, Corrigan acknowledged, \"did produce a small reduction in the debt to GDP ratio at the time.\" The ratio in turn was a factor in the economic management of Greek finances within the European Union and the Euro currency, and in the context of the 2010 European sovereign debt crisis. Corrigan's testimony continued, \"With the benefit of hindsight, it seems very clear that standards of transparency could have been and should have been higher.\" The report on his testimony concluded, \"Corrigan's key defence against the Greek allegations was that every bank was cooking up deals with European governments \u2014 not just Greece. It's no lie.\"In the May 7, 2010, Goldman public stockholders' meeting, the company \"announced the creation of an internal committee that will examine possible conflicts of interest and other issues such as transparency and disclosure. It's headed by Vice Chairman [Michael] Evans and ... Corrigan, chairman of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. No board members are involved.\" The report on this development was part of a larger analysis of the role of the board of directors in the oversight of the management, business and ethics of the company, in light of the intense scrutiny of the company's role in the national and global financial crises of recent years.",

        "Admission of market manipulation": "In a December 2006 interview, Cramer described activities used by hedge fund managers to manipulate stock prices\u2014some of debatable legality and others illegal. He described how he could push stocks higher or lower with as little as $5 million in capital when he was running his hedge fund. Cramer said, \"A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... When I was positioned short\u2014meaning I needed it down\u2014I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures.\" He also encouraged hedge funds to engage in this type of activity because it is \"a very quick way to make money.\"Cramer stated that everything he did was legal, but that illegal activity is common in the hedge fund industry as well. He also stated that some hedge fund managers spread false rumors to drive a stock down: \"What's important when you are in that hedge-fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth, to develop a fiction.\" Cramer described a variety of tactics that hedge fund managers use to affect a stock's price. Cramer said that one strategy to keep a stock price down is to spread false rumors to reporters he described as \"the Pisanis of the world\", in reference to CNBC correspondent Bob Pisani, whom Cramer insinuated was able to be manipulated, saying \"You have to use these guys.\" He also discussed giving information to \"the bozo reporter from The Wall Street Journal\" to get an article published. Cramer said this practice, although illegal, is easy to do \"because the SEC doesn't understand it.\" During the interview, Cramer referred to himself as a \"banking-class hero.\"",
        "Performance of Cramer's investments": "As manager of his hedge fund, Cramer said he realized a \"rate of return of 24% after all fees for 15 years,\" until he retired from the hedge fund in 2001. He self-reported a 36% return in 2000, at the peak of the dot-com bubble. However, this performance has not been independently verified.In January 2000, close to the peak of the dot-com bubble, Cramer recommended investing in technology stocks, and suggested a repeat of the stock performance of 1999. In February 2000, the year in which Cramer said he produced a 36% return, Cramer said that there were only 10 stocks he wanted to own, and he was buying them every day. These stocks were 724 Solutions, Ariba, Digital Island, Exodus Communications, InfoSpace, Inktomi, Mercury Interactive, Sonera, VeriSign, and Veritas Software. He also dismissed the investing strategy of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, and said that price\u2013earnings ratios did not matter.An August 20, 2007, article in Barron's stated that \"his picks haven't beaten the market. Over the past two years, viewers holding Cramer's stocks would be up 12% while the Dow rose 22% and the S&P 500 16%.\"Cramer was criticized for repeatedly giving erroneous advice during the Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. He recommended investing in Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wachovia, and Lehman Brothers before the stocks fell in value significantly and several went out of business. On August 8, 2008, before the climax of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Cramer recommended investing in bank stocks.On October 6, 2008, on Today, when the S&P 500 Index was valued at 1,056, Cramer suggested to investors, \"Whatever money you need for the next five years, please take it out of the stock market.\" Five months later, the market bottomed at 666, a 36.9% decline. Five years after Cramer's sell advice, on October 6, 2013, the S&P 500 Index was valued at 1,678, an increase of 58.7%.A February 9, 2009, article in The Wall Street Journal said that betting against Cramer's Buy recommendations using short-term options could yield 25% in a month.",
        "Recommendation regarding Bear Stearns in March 2008": "On the March 11, 2008, episode of Cramer's show Mad Money, a viewer submitted the question \"Should I be worried about Bear Stearns in terms of liquidity and get my money out of there?\" Cramer responded \"No! No! No! Bear Stearns is not in trouble. If anything, they're more likely to be taken over. Don't move your money from Bear.\" On March 14, 2008, the stock lost more than half of its value on news of a Fed bailout and $2/share takeover by JPMorgan Chase. On March 17, 2008, Cramer said his statements were made in regards to the liquidity of accounts held at Bear Stearns as opposed to the stock. Cramer said he was not recommending the common stock, but allaying concerns about the account holder's liquidity held in a Bear Stearns brokerage account. Cramer later wrote about the incident: \"I did tell an emailer that his deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe, but through a clever sound bite, (Jon) Stewart, and subsequently (Frank) Rich\u2014neither of whom have bothered to listen to the context of the pulled quote\u2014pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. The absurdity astounds me. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more.\"An article by author Michael Lewis for Bloomberg News said that TheStreet.com listed Bear Stearns as a \"Buy\" at $62 per share on March 11, 2008, which was the same day as the caller's question and a day before the collapse of Bear Stearns. During the Jon Stewart\u2013Jim Cramer conflict, on The Daily Show on March 12, 2009, Cramer admitted he made mistakes on his Bear Stearns calls.",
        "Performance of Action Alerts charitable trust": "Cramer says that, between 2002 and May 2009, the performance of his \"Action Alerts PLUS\" charitable trust outpaced the S&P 500 Index and the Russell 2000 Index. The charitable trust realized a return of 31.75%, the S&P 500 had a return of 18.75%, and the Russell 2000 had a return of 22.51%. On an annual basis, the trust outperformed the S&P 500 by 7.35%, and the Russell 2000 Index by 3.33%. Paul Bolster said that Cramer beats the market in part because of the excess risk in his picks. \"If we adjust for his market risk, we come up with an excess return that is essentially zero\", Bolster said, adding that \"zero\", in this case, means his returns are roughly in line with the risk he's taking on. Another criticism of Actions Alerts Plus was that it did not compare itself to indexes that include dividend reinvestment (as the SEC requires for stock-oriented mutual funds). According to Kiplinger's article \"One recent [Action Alerts PLUS] and included a chart, under the headline \"Action Alert PLUS is CRUSHING the S&P 500,\" showing that the picks returned about 39% from the portfolio's inception through last March 31, compared with 15.5% for the S&P 500 over the same nine-year, three-month period. But the S&P figure did not include reinvested dividends. With them, the S&P 500 returned 38.3%.\"A study by Wharton researchers Jonathan Hartley and Matthew Olson found that in the timeframe of August 2001 to March 2016, Cramer's charitable trust underperformed the S&P 500 primarily as a result of underexposure to market returns in years after the 2008 financial crisis. As of March 31, 2016, Cramer's trust since inception had a cumulative return of 64.5%, whereas the S&P 500 fewer dividends returned 70% during the same timeframe. Wharton finance professor Robert Stambaugh said he didn't think the findings showed significant underperformance or outperformance when adjusting for a variety of factors, but did say \"It's a commendable attempt to dig more deeply into the style that underlies Cramer's stock picks.\"",
        "Criticism of President Obama's policies in March 2009": "On March 2, 2009, Cramer said that President Barack Obama was on a \"radical agenda,\" and said that was responsible for \"the greatest wealth destruction I have seen by a president\". In response to a reporter's question, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs replied, \"If you turn on a certain program, it's geared to a very small audience. I'm not entirely sure what he's pointing to make some of the statements..... You can go back and look at any number of statements he's made in the past about the economy and wonder where some of the back-ups for those are, too.\"On March 5, 2009, Cramer responded to the White House, saying, \"Backup? Look at the incredible decline in the stock market, in all indices, since the inauguration of the president, with the drop accelerating when the budget plan came to light because of the massive fear and indecision the document sowed: Raising taxes on the eve of what could be a second Great Depression, destroying the profits in healthcare companies, tinkering with the mortgage deduction at a time when U.S. house price depreciation is behind much of the world's morass and certainly the devastation affecting our banks, and pushing an aggressive cap and trade program that could raise the price of energy for millions of people.\" By the end of Obama's term in office, major stock market indexes had more than doubled from the levels of March 2009.",
        "Subsequent debate with Frank Rich": "Referring to March 8, 2009, charges leveled against Cramer by The New York Times columnist Frank Rich, Cramer said that he does not understand how Obama and his staff planned to raise taxes, institute cap-and-trade limitations, and rework the healthcare system all during a recession. The article said: \"It isn't that Cramer disagrees with Obama's vision for the country \u2013 he even agrees with taxing the rich \u2013 but now is not the time to put those plans into action. The president needs to solve our housing, employment, and financial problems, and only then turn his attention to healthcare and changing the mortgage deduction.\"",
        "Controversy with Nouriel Roubini": "Cramer wrote in 2009 that Nouriel Roubini was \"intoxicated\" with his own \"prescience and vision,\" and should realize that things are better than he predicted. Roubini called Cramer a \"buffoon,\" and told him to \"just shut up\".",
        "Debate with Jon Stewart in 2009": "On March 12, 2009, Cramer appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Stewart reiterated earlier claims regarding the CNBC host's \"silly and/or embarrassing and/or stupid financial observations.\" Moreover, he said CNBC shirked its journalistic duty by believing corporate lies rather than being an investigative \"powerful tool of illumination.\" Cramer disagreed with Stewart on a few points, but acknowledged that he could have done a better job foreseeing the economic collapse: \"We all should have seen it more.\"Stewart also discussed how short-selling was detrimental to the markets and investors. Cramer said to Stewart that short-selling was detrimental, stated his opposition to it, and said that he had never engaged in it. This contradicted earlier statements in which he described going short while managing a hedge fund. In a December 2006 interview from TheStreet.com's \"Wall Street Confidential\" webcast, Cramer said, \"A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund. ... When I was positioned short\u2014meaning I needed it down\u2014I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures.\" He said, \"I will say this: I am trying to expose this stuff, exactly what you guys do, and I've been trying to get the regulators to look at it.\" However, Stewart played several video clips from 2006 where Cramer discussed the spreading of false rumors to drive down stock prices and encouraged short-selling by hedge funds as a means to generate returns. At one point in a clip from December 22, 2006, he said, \"I would encourage anyone in a hedge fund to do it.\" He called it a very quick way to make money and very satisfying. He continued, \"By the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that, but I don't care, and again, I'm not gonna say it on TV.\" Stewart responded, \"I want the Jim Cramer on CNBC to protect me from that Jim Cramer.\" Cramer again admitted that he could do better and that he should try to change. The interview ended when Stewart pointedly suggested: \"Maybe we can remove the 'financial expert' and the 'In Cramer We Trust' and start getting back to fundamentals on the reporting, as well, and I can go back to making fart noises and funny faces.\" Cramer responded: \"I think we make that deal right here\".",
        "Criticism of the Federal Reserve in 2007-2008": "On August 3, 2007, in what was described a \"rant\" Cramer made a plea for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Cramer said of the Fed Committee, \"They're nuts. They know nothing. This is a different kinda market. And the Fed is asleep.\" When the transcript from the August 7, 2007, meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee was subsequently released on August 28, 2007, it showed that Cramer's comments elicited laughter from participants during a comment from Dennis Lockhart, president, and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \"I believe that the correct policy posture is to let the markets work through the changes in risk appetite and pricing that are underway, but the market observations of one of my more strident conversational counterparts\u2014and that is not Jim Cramer [laughter]\u2014are worth sharing.\" Cramer was vindicated for his negative outlook when the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the Great Recession took hold.On Hardball with Chris Matthews on September 19, 2008, Cramer blamed the Federal Reserve for the United States housing bubble.",
        "\"Inverse Cramer\" ETF": "In 2022, in response to a long-running series of unrelated humorous comments on betting against Cramer's stock recommendations, The Financial Times uncovered SEC filings which revealed that Tuttle Capital Management, the same firm behind an ETF which betted against Cathie Wood's ARK funds, had filed to launch two funds with one labeled \"LJIM\" and the other \"IJIM\", representing \"Long Cramer\" (which would bet with all of Cramer's recommendations) and \"Inverse Cramer\" (betting against everything that Cramer recommended) respectively. The Inverse Cramer ETF listed in its filings that aside from jokes or obviously meritable investment recommendations, in general, the fund would bet against all of Cramer's recommendations both on Mad Money and Cramer's Twitter feed, and the fund estimates to have a \"high turnover rate\". The fund gained additional coverage upon Meta Platforms' Q3 2022 earnings miss and Cramer's subsequent apology, which outlined another loss for the company and was seen by some that Cramer's apology was seen as a sign to buy Meta stock.Upon the launch of the fund, prior to Meta's earnings, Cramer responded on Twitter by touting his reputation and claiming the ETF would not last long before stating he wouldn't be making further comments on the company. He apparently reversed this decision, though, and continued to make comments before seemingly reversing course and \"welcoming\" the fund, though further touting his reputation.",
        "SEC subpoena of journalists in conjunction with its investigation of Gradient Analytics": "In February 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  served subpoenas requesting information from several journalists, including Cramer, in conjunction with allegations of collusion between short-sellers of Overstock.com and Gradient Analytics, a stock research firm. The SEC indicated it had no intention of enforcing the subpoenas after lawyers for Dow Jones objected to the government's demands for communications between journalists and their sources. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said neither he nor any of the SEC's four other commissioners were aware of the subpoenas, which he called \"highly unusual.\"",
        "Calling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"Crazy Nancy\" during an interview": "On September 15, 2020, during a TV interview with US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Cramer addressed her as \"Crazy Nancy\", and then sent several tweets in which he defended his actions. He later apologized for using the phrase, which was also employed frequently by President Donald Trump.  During a discussion about the likelihood of a coronavirus relief bill, Cramer expressed doubt over the deal saying, \"I mean, what deal can we have, Crazy Nancy?\"  He then quickly added \"I'm sorry, I\u2014that was the president. I have such reverence for the office, I would never use that term.\" \"But you just did,\" Pelosi replied.",
        "Personal life": "From 1988 to 2009, Cramer was married to Karen Backfisch, with whom he had two children. On April 18, 2015, Cramer married Lisa Cadette Detwiler, a real-estate broker, and general manager of The Longshoreman, an Italian bistro/restaurant in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City.In a 2013 interview on The Carlos Watson Show Cramer said that he dealt  with mental health issues surrounding his anger and his workplace behavior, attributing the problem to his childhood experiences with his father.Cramer lives in Summit, New Jersey. He also has a 65-acre estate in the New Jersey countryside, and a summer house in Quogue, New York, on Long Island.In 2009, Cramer and four other investors purchased the DeBary Inn in Summit, New Jersey. He and his wife also own Bar San Miguel, a restaurant and bar serving Mexican cuisine in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.Cramer was one of about 200 candidates for the Time 100 in 2009.Cramer loves Philadelphia, and has said the key to an economic resurgence of the city is a high-speed rail connection with New York City.He is a passionate Philadelphia Eagles fan, and cried after the team was victorious in Super Bowl LII. He has held season tickets for 20 years and has met former Eagles coach Doug Pederson many times.In December 2021, Cramer announced he tested positive for COVID-19 after attending an event that required PCR testing. He said his symptoms were mild due to having had two injections of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and a Moderna booster. His wife was sicker and she received the Johnson & Johnson initial dose and the Moderna booster.",

    "Heidi Cruz": {
        "Introduction": "Heidi Suzanne Cruz (n\u00e9e Nelson; born August 7, 1972) is an American businesswoman. She has been a managing director at Goldman Sachs since 2012.\nCruz completed her tertiary education at Claremont McKenna College, the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, and Harvard Business School. She was an economic policy adviser to George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign and subsequently held various positions in the Bush Admistration, including as an advisor to the Treasury Department and National Security Council. In 2005 she joined Goldman Sachs as a private wealth manager.\nIn 2001, she married future U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, with whom she has two daughters. In his 2016 presidential campaign, she took a leave of absence to work as his primary fundraiser and surrogate.",
        "Early and personal life": "Heidi Suzanne Nelson was born on August 7, 1972, in San Luis Obispo, California, to Suzanne Jane (n\u00e9e Rouhe), a dental hygienist, and Peter Christian Nelson, a dentist. Nelson was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist. Her maternal grandfather Olavi Johannes Rouhe was from Savonlinna, Finland. During a part of Nelson's childhood, she lived with her family in Kenya, Nigeria, and throughout Asia, where they served as missionaries, while both parents participated in dental health work. Nelson became interested in business as a child, and sold homemade bread with her brother, Scott.Nelson attended Valley View Adventist Academy in Arroyo Grande, near her home town of San Luis Obispo. She completed her secondary education in 1990, at Monterey Bay Academy, an Adventist boarding school about 150 miles north in La Selva Beach, California. Following high school, Nelson attended Claremont McKenna College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in Economics and International Relations in 1994. While attending the school, she was active in the student Republican group. While at Claremont McKenna, she studied abroad at the University of Strasbourg. In 1995, she received a Masters of European Business degree from Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management of the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium. Her second graduate degree was an MBA from Harvard Business School in 2000.Subsequent to getting married in 2001, Cruz moved from Washington D.C. to Texas in 2004, and experienced a period of depression as a result of the transition. Cruz and her husband have two daughters, Caroline and Catherine. Since 2011, she characterizes herself as the primary breadwinner of the family. Cruz converted to the Southern Baptist denomination, though she still maintains a vegetarian diet in adherence with her Adventist upbringing.During the 2021 Texas power crisis, she and her family decided to vacation in Canc\u00fan, Mexico; Cruz reportedly messaged friends and neighbors to propose a stay at the Ritz-Carlton, partly on the grounds that the nightly rate was attractive. Cruz's messages and her role in the vacation placed her at the center of an international scandal; in addition to leaving the state during a period of crisis, the Cruzes came under fire for traveling internationally both during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the deadly storm, thereby violating official government guidelines, the guidelines of the school where their daughters are enrolled, and Ted Cruz's own public recommendations.",
        "Career": "In 2000, Nelson worked as an economic policy director on the Bush for President campaign, where she met her future husband Ted Cruz. Following her marriage to Ted Cruz in 2001, she went on to work for the Bush administration; she began as a top deputy to U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Zoellick, focusing on economic policy. Cruz worked as director of the Latin America desk at the Department of Treasury in 2002. She taught herself how to speak Spanish between jobs.In 2003, Cruz reported directly to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. Cruz eventually became the director for the Western Hemisphere on the National Security Council where she \"had Rice's ear.\" During a New York Times interview, Cruz recalled enjoying her tenure with the Bush administration and found her work to be \"personally fulfilling.\" That year, she delivered the commencement address for the graduating class of Tennessee's Southern Adventist University. After commuting between Washington, D.C. and her husband's home state of Texas for a year, she moved to Texas in 2004, where she briefly worked for Merrill Lynch. She has previously worked for JPMorgan Chase.  In 2005, she began working for Goldman Sachs as a private wealth manager.From 2005 to 2011, she was an active member of the Council on Foreign Relations and was a member of the Independent Task Force on North America that in 2005, published a report entitled \"Building a North American Community.\" Cruz sits on the Board of Directors for the Greater Houston Partnership. After seven years at Goldman Sachs, Cruz was promoted in 2012, to regional head of the Southwest United States for the Investment Management Division in Houston. In 2019, the Trump Administration interviewed Cruz as a finalist for the position of president of the World Bank.",
        "Role in 2016 presidential campaign": "Cruz took a leave of absence without pay to participate in her husband's 2016 presidential campaign. During the campaign, she made multiple solo public appearances, speaking on her husband's behalf. Former George W. Bush administration official Sara Taylor Fagen said she was successful in softening her husband's image, which she further argued was essential for \"a candidate whose main obstacle to the Republican nomination may be tone and personality\", though director of the SuperPAC Our Principles PAC Katie Packer argued her help could only go so far and voters would not support a candidate based on their spouse.",
        "Early campaigning": "Early in her husband's campaign, Cruz's initial role was that of fundraiser, making calls to potential donors, seeking to \"max out\" investments to the Cruz campaign. Cruz's call list included donor names provided to her by a super PAC. Campaign chairman Chad Sweet compared Cruz's ability to make campaign calls to her time at Goldman Sachs, stating, \"There are very few spouses who can get on the phone on a cold call to a prospective donor and make a more compelling case in a personal and effective way than Heidi Cruz.\"Beginning in August 2015, Cruz regularly attended presidential debates in which her husband participated. When asked what her role would be as First Lady, she expressed an intent to raise \"the standard of living for those at the bottom of the economic ladder in this country\", explaining that her interests are on \"the economic side\". During a two-day trip to Alabama in November 2015, she delivered signatures and payment required for her husband to appear on that state's ballot at the Alabama Republican Party headquarters in Hoover.On December 3, Cruz returned to Texas to file paperwork for her husband's name to appear on the state ballot. She acknowledged she had previously filed for his name on ballots in previous states, but also said the Cruz campaign had \"a campaign strategy that's built to last, and we have built a grass-roots army that this country hasn't seen since Ronald Reagan.\" Having made televised solo appearances on Fox Business Network, and KTRK-TV, it was noted by Patrick Svitek of The Texas Tribune that she had become more visible in the previous months than she had been before.",
        "Primaries": "Cruz stumped for her husband in Iowa ahead of the 2016 Republican caucuses, appearing in the state multiple times. Ted Cruz ultimately won the state, which she believed was due to \"one strong voice of the people coming together\". For New Hampshire, another early primary state, it was reported in January that she would make stops there to rally support for her husband. In February, Cruz was reported to be headlining a luncheon for Republican women in Reno, Nevada, days before the state's primary.Cruz's campaigning in Texas was viewed by commentators (including potential voters) as essential to her husband's winning of his home state on Super Tuesday.  \nAt the time of her campaigning in Texas, Ted Cruz was expected to win the state, the move being seen as the Cruz campaign not wanting to take any chances. According to Cruz, both she and her husband were confident about his prospects of winning. She emphasized the state as both her and her husband's home state. After Super Tuesday, Cruz herself subsequently campaigned independently in North Carolina, Illinois, and Missouri. She then substituted for her husband in Fayetteville, North Carolina, speaking at Fayetteville Technical Community College in promotion of him, and jointly appeared with her husband in Wisconsin. Weeks before the state primaries, Cruz appeared in Indiana. Ted Cruz dropped out of the primary after a loss in Indiana to Donald Trump on May 3, 2016.Prior to dropping out, Cruz was involved in a Twitter feud with Donald Trump after he retweeted a composite image of an unflattering photo of Heidi next to a photo of Melania Trump, captioning it with \"No need to \u2018spill the beans.\u2019 The images are worth a thousand words.\u201d",

Van Dam put up the sterling equivalent of $1 million of his own money for the novices to trade with over the course of eight weeks. As with the original experiment, those who lasted the course broadly confirmed the claim that novices could become professional-level traders, making small profits or at least lower losses trading in very turbulent markets during the filming than professionals, who lost four times greater amounts over the same period. Van Dam set up the experiment to encourage the public to take greater control of their personal finances in the wake of the global financial crisis.\nLater that year, a companion book How to Make Money Trading was released in order to expand on the trading techniques featured in the television series.In November 2010, he launched The Lex van Dam Trading Academy which aims to teach people how to trade and invest in the stock market based on his 5-Step-Trading\u00ae methodology.Together with David Winner he translated a book about the football player Johan Cruyff, entitled Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff, The ABC of a destinate Maestro by Frits Barend and Henk van Dorp."

He is best known as a quantitative analyst, and author of the book My Life as a Quant: Reflections on Physics and Finance.He is a co-author of Black\u2013Derman\u2013Toy model, one of the first interest-rate models, and the Derman\u2013Kani local volatility or implied tree model, a model consistent with the volatility smile.\nDerman, who first came to the U.S. at age 21, in 1966, is currently a professor at Columbia University and Director of its program in financial engineering. Until recently he was also the Head of Risk and a partner at KKR Prisma Capital Partners, a fund of funds. His book My Life as a Quant: Reflections on Physics and Finance, published by Wiley in September 2004, was one of Business Week's top ten books of the year for 2004. In 2011, he published Models.Behaving.Badly, a book contrasting financial models with the theories of hard science, and also containing some autobiographical material.",
        "Biography": "Born to a South African Jewish family, Derman obtained a B.Sc. (Hons) at the University of Cape Town, and received a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Columbia in 1973, where he wrote a thesis that proposed a test for a weak-neutral current in electron-hadron scattering. This experiment was carried out at SLAC in 1978 by a team led by Charles Prescott and Richard Taylor, and confirmed the Weinberg\u2013Salam model. Between 1973 and 1980 he did research in theoretical particle physics at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Oxford, Rockefeller University and the University of Colorado at Boulder. From 1980 to 1985 he worked at AT&T Bell Laboratories, where he developed computer languages for business modeling applications.\nIn 1985 Derman joined Goldman Sachs' fixed income division where he was one of the co-developers of the Black\u2013Derman\u2013Toy interest-rate model.\nHe left Goldman Sachs at the end of 1988 to take a position at Salomon Brothers Inc. as head of Adjustable Rate Mortgage Research in the Bond Portfolio Analysis group.\nRehired by Goldman Sachs, from 1990 to 2000 he led the Quantitative Strategies group in the Equities division, which pioneered the study of local volatility models and the volatility smile. He was appointed a managing director of Goldman Sachs in 1997. In 2000, he became head of the firm\u2019s Quantitative Risk Strategies group.  He retired from Goldman Sachs in 2002 and took a position at Columbia University and Prisma Capital Partners (acquired by KKR) .\nDerman was named the IAFE/SunGard Financial Engineer of the Year 2000, and was elected to the Risk Hall of Fame in 2002. He is the author of numerous articles on quantitative finance on the topics of volatility and the nature of financial modeling.\nSince 1995, Derman has written many articles pointing out the essential difference between models in physics and models in finance. Good models in physics aim to predict the future accurately from the present, or to predict new previously unobserved phenomena; models in finance are used mostly to estimate the values of illiquid securities from liquid ones. Models in physics deal with objective variables; models in finance deal with subjective ones. \u201cIn physics there may one day be a Theory of Everything; in finance and the social sciences, you\u2019re lucky if there is a usable theory of anything.\u201d\nDerman together with Paul Wilmott wrote the Financial Modelers' Manifesto, a set of principles for doing responsible financial modeling.From February 2011 to July 2012, Derman wrote a financial blog for Reuters. Beginning in September 2012, for one year, Derman wrote a regular column for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.",
        "Models.Behaving.Badly": "In 2011, Derman published a new book titled Models.Behaving.Badly: Why Confusing Illusion With Reality Can Lead to Disaster, on Wall Street and in Life. In that work he decries the breakdown of capitalism as a model during the bailouts characterizing the  2008 financial crisis and calls for a return to principles, to the notion that if you want to take a chance on the upside, you have also taken a chance on the downside.\nMore generally, he analyzes three ways of understanding the behavior of the world: models, theory and intuition. Models, he argues, are merely metaphors that compare something you would like to understand with something you already do. Models provide relative knowledge. Theories, in contrast, are attempts to understand the world on absolute terms; while models stand on someone else's legs, theories, like Newton's or Maxwell's or Spinoza's, stand on their own. Intuition, the deepest kind of knowledge, comes only occasionally, after long and hard work, and is a merging of the understander with the understood. His book elaborates on these ideas with examples from the theories of physics and philosophy, and the models of finance.",
        "The Volatility Smile": "In 2016, Derman and Michael Miller published a textbook titled The Volatility Smile, a textbook about the principles of financial modeling, option valuation, and the variety of models that can account for the volatility smile.",

    "Mario Draghi": {
        "Introduction": "Mario Draghi  (Italian: [\u02c8ma\u02d0rjo \u02c8dra\u02d0\u0261i]; born 3 September 1947) is an Italian economist, academic, banker and civil servant who served as prime minister of Italy from 13 February 2021 to 22 October 2022. Prior to his appointment as prime minister, he served as President of the European Central Bank (ECB) between 2011 and 2019. Draghi was also Chair of the Financial Stability Board between 2009 and 2011, and Governor of the Bank of Italy between 2006 and 2011.After a lengthy career as an academic economist in Italy, Draghi worked for the World Bank in Washington, D.C., throughout the 1980s, and in 1991 returned to Rome to become Director General of the Italian Treasury. He left that role after a decade to join Goldman Sachs, where he remained until his appointment as Governor of the Bank of Italy in 2006. His tenure as Governor coincided with the 2008 Great Recession, and in the midst of this he was selected to become the first Chair of the Financial Stability Board, the global standard-setter that replaced the Financial Stability Forum.\nHe left those roles after his nomination by the European Council in 2011 to serve as President of the ECB. He presided over the institution during the Eurozone crisis, becoming famous throughout Europe for saying that he would be prepared to do \"whatever it takes\" to prevent the euro from failing.  In 2014, Draghi was listed by Forbes as the eighth-most powerful person in the world. In 2015, Fortune magazine ranked him as the world's \"second greatest leader\". He is also the only Italian to be listed three times in the Time 100 annual listicle. In 2019, Paul Krugman described him as \"the greatest central banker of modern times.\" Moreover, thanks to his monetary policies, he is widely considered the \"saviour of the euro\" during the European debt crisis. He has been nicknamed Super Mario by some media, a nickname that was popularised during his time as President of the ECB, when he was credited by numerous sources as having played a key role in combatting the Eurozone crisis.After Draghi's term as ECB President ended in 2019, he initially returned to private life. On 3 February 2021, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, Draghi was invited by President Sergio Mattarella to form a government of national unity (Draghi Cabinet), following the resignation of Giuseppe Conte. After successful negotiations with parties including the League (Lega), the Five Star Movement (M5S), the Democratic Party (PD), and Forza Italia (FI), Draghi was sworn in as Prime Minister on 11 February, pledging to oversee effective implementation of COVID-19 economic stimulus. Draghi has been rated highly in public opinion polls in Italy during his time as prime minister; at the end of his first year in office Politico Europe ranked him as the most powerful person in Europe and The Economist named Italy as \"Country of the Year\", singling out Draghi's leadership as central to its nomination.On 14 July 2022, the M5S revoked support to Draghi's coalition government regarding a decree concerning economic stimulus to offset the energy crisis. On the same day, despite having largely won the confidence vote, Draghi announced his resignation as prime minister, which was rejected by President Mattarella. On 21 July, Draghi resigned for a second time following the failure of the confidence vote to pass with an absolute majority due to the withdrawals of M5S, Lega, and FI. On the same day, President Mattarella accepted the resignation and Draghi remained in office as caretaker prime minister. He was succeeded by Giorgia Meloni on 22 October 2022.",
        "Early life and education": "Mario Draghi was born in Rome in 1947 to an upper-class family; his father Carlo, who was born in Padua, first joined the Bank of Italy in 1922, and later worked for the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction (IRI) and for the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro; while his mother, Gilda Mancini, who was born in Monteverde, Campania, near Avellino, was a pharmacist. He is the eldest of three children including Andreina, an art historian, and Marcello, an entrepreneur. When he was 15 years old, his father died; at 19, his mother died.Draghi studied at the Massimiliano Massimo Institute, a Jesuit school in Rome, where he was a classmate of the future chairman of Ferrari, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the future prefect and civil servant Gianni De Gennaro and the future television presenter Giancarlo Magalli. In 1970, he graduated with honours in economics at the Sapienza University of Rome, under the supervision of Keynesian economist Federico Caff\u00e8; his graduation dissertation was titled \"Economic integration and the variation of exchange rates\". In his dissertation, Draghi was particularly critical of Luxembourg Prime Minister Pierre Werner's remarks that European monetary union was \"premature\". Draghi went on to earn a PhD in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1976, this time with a dissertation titled \"Essays on economic theory and applications\", under the supervision of Franco Modigliani and Robert Solow.",

In 1983, Draghi was also appointed a counsellor to then-Minister of Treasury Giovanni Goria.In 1991, Minister of Treasury Guido Carli and Bank of Italy Governor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi appointed Draghi as Director General of the Italian Treasury; Draghi held this senior position in the civil service until 2001. During his time at the Treasury, he chaired the committee that revised Italian corporate and financial legislation, and drafted the law that continues to govern Italian financial markets. Draghi was also among the main proponents of the privatisations of many state-owned companies which occurred in the Italian economy through the 1990s. He also chaired the management committee of SACE, implementing a complete reformation of the group and managing the transition from the Mani Pulite corruption scandal. Draghi returned to chair SACE between 1998 and 2001, before the subsequent privatisation. During these years, he was also a board member of several Italian banks and corporations, like Eni, Institute for Industrial Reconstruction, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Istituto Mobiliare Italiano.In 2001, he left the Treasury to become a fellow of the Institute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Draghi was also appointed as Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Goldman Sachs International in 2002. He was also made a member of the firm's management committee, holding all of these roles until 2005. He led Goldman Sachs's European strategy and its engagements with major European corporations and governments. After the revelation that off-market swaps had been systematically used by the Greek Government, facilitated by Goldman Sachs, Draghi stated that he \"knew nothing\" about the arrangement, and \"had nothing to do with it\". During this period, Draghi also worked as a trustee at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and also spent time as a consultant at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.",
        "Governor of the Bank of Italy": "In December 2005, it was announced that Draghi would become Governor of the Bank of Italy. He officially took up the position on 16 January 2006. In April 2006, he was elected by fellow central bank governors to become Chairman of the Financial Stability Forum; this body would later be re-organised to become the Financial Stability Board in April 2009 on behalf of the G20, bringing together representatives of governments, central banks and national supervisors institutions in the wake of the financial crisis. As the inaugural FSB Chairman, Draghi was responsible to the G20 leaders, and worked to promote international financial stability, improve the functioning of markets and reduce systemic risk through information exchange and international cooperation between supervisors.\nIn his capacity as Bank of Italy Governor, Draghi was also a member of the Governing and General Councils of the European Central Bank and a member of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements. He also represented Italy on the Board of Governors at both the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank. On 5 August 2011, he made a contribution to domestic political debate when, together with the ECB President Jean Claude Trichet, he published a notable letter to the Italian Government of Silvio Berlusconi to recommend a series of economic measures that should urgently be implemented in Italy.",
        "President of the European Central Bank": "Draghi had for years been mentioned as a possible successor to Jean-Claude Trichet, whose term as President of the European Central Bank was due to end in October 2011. On 13 February 2011, Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau, associate editor of the Financial Times, endorsed Draghi as the best candidate for the position. A few days later, The Economist wrote that \"the next president of the world's second-most-important central bank should be Mario Draghi\". Draghi subsequently won the support of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for the position, who expressed a desire to see an Italian take the pre-eminent economic policymaking role within the European Union. On 17 May 2011, the Council of the European Union recommended the nomination of Draghi as President of the ECB. Draghi's nomination was later approved by the European Parliament and the ECB itself, and on 24 June 2011 his appointment was signed-off by EU leaders. During the nomination process, some concerns were raised about Draghi's past employment at Goldman Sachs. As a member of the Group of Thirty, founded by the Rockefeller Foundation, he was accused in Der Spiegel, Tagesschau.de and Die Welt of having a conflict of interest as president of the ECB. Draghi moved to Frankfurt and formally took up the role of ECB President on 1 November 2011, the day after Trichet's term expired.In December 2011, Draghi brokered a \u20ac489 billion three-year loan program from the ECB to EU banks. Draghi's ECB also promptly repealed the final two interest rate hikes of Trichet's term, stating this would ease the continuing European sovereign debt crisis. In February 2012, Nobel Prize laureate in economics, Joseph Stiglitz argued that on the issue of the impending Greek debt restructuring, the ECB's insistence that it should be \"voluntary\", as opposed to a default agreed by Greek authorities, would be \"a gift\" to the financial institutions that sold credit default insurance on that debt, a position Stiglitz argued was a moral hazard. In March 2012, a second, larger round of ECB loans to EU banks was initiated, this time called the Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO). One commentator, Matthew Lynn, saw the ECB's injection of funds, along with quantitative easing from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, as feeding increases in oil prices in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn July 2012, in the midst of renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone, Draghi stated in a panel discussion that, under his leadership, the ECB \"is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.\" This statement was heavily reported throughout the EU and the world's financial markets, and initially led to a steady decline in bond yields (borrowing costs) for eurozone countries, in particular Spain, Italy and France. In light of what had been slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis, Draghi's statement has come to be seen subsequently as the major turning point in the fortunes of the eurozone, with numerous policymakers and commentators describing it as having been essential to the continuation of the euro currency.Draghi has since come to be prominently associated with the phrase \"whatever it takes\". Beginning in 2013, Draghi was criticised in the context of the scandals rising around the bank Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which according to at least one German publication was making very risky deals.\n\nIn April 2013, Draghi said in response to a question regarding membership of the eurozone, \"These questions are formulated by people who vastly underestimate what the euro means for the Europeans, for the euro area. They vastly underestimate the political capital that has been invested in the euro.\" In 2015, in an appearance before the European Parliament, Draghi said that the future of the eurozone was at risk unless member countries gave up some independence and created more Pan-European government institutions. \"We have not yet reached the stage of a genuine monetary union,\" Draghi said. Failure of eurozone countries to harmonise their economies and create stronger institutions would, he said, \"put at risk the long-term success of the monetary union when faced with an important shock.\" In 2015, Draghi said that his political ideas belong to liberal socialism.On 31 October 2019, his mandate as ECB President expired and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde was appointed as his successor.",
        "Prime Minister of Italy (2021\u20132022)": "No information",
        "Government formation": "Between December 2020 and January 2021, tensions arose within Italy's ruling coalition, with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi taking contrary positions on the management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy as well as its deep economic consequences. On 13 January, Renzi announced the resignation of the two Cabinet Ministers from his party, Italia Viva, triggering the collapse of the second Conte Government. On 26 January, after days of inconclusive negotiations with political parties, Conte tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to President Mattarella.On 2 February 2021, following failed consultations between parties to nominate a replacement, President Mattarella announced he would summon Draghi to the Quirinal Palace, with the intention of giving him the task of forming a technocratic government. The following day, Draghi accepted the task of forming a new government and began consultations with party leaders. Draghi quickly secured the support of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), the centrist Italia Viva (IV), the left-wing Free and Equal (LeU), and other small liberal and centrist parties. After an initial delay, Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-wing League, and Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the centre-right Forza Italia, jointly announced they too would support Draghi. Finally, on 11 February, the membership of the Five Star Movement (M5S) approved the party's support for Draghi, with 59.3% of party members voting in favour of joining the new government.\n\nOn 12 February, Draghi unveiled the members of his Cabinet, which included representatives from all of the above political parties, including 9 ministers from the outgoing cabinet, as well as independent technocrats. The following day, Draghi was sworn in as Prime Minister. Draghi's cabinet was described as a national unity government in the wake of its announcement.On 17 February, Draghi won a confidence vote in the Senate, with 262 votes in favour, 40 against and 2 abstentions. On the following day, he won a further confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies with 535 votes in favour, 56 against and 5 abstentions; this margin represented one of the largest ever majorities in the history of the Italian Republic. During his first speech as Prime Minister to both houses of the Italian Parliament, Draghi stated that the Italy that emerged after the COVID-19 pandemic would have to undergo a period of reconstruction similar to post-World War II Italy, and that it would be his government's responsibility to begin this process. He also stressed that his government would adopt a strongly pro-European position, and emphasised the importance of Italy remaining within the Eurosystem.On 13 May, it was announced that Draghi would forgo his annual salary of \u20ac115,000 for being Prime Minister.",
        "COVID-19 pandemic": "Addressing the nation shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Draghi stated that it would be his government's priority to plan a route out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and pledged to reorganise the country's pandemic response units; on 27 February, Draghi replaced the Head of the Civil Protection, Angelo Borrelli, with Fabrizio Curcio, and on 1 March, he replaced the Extraordinary Commissioner for the COVID-19 Emergency, Domenico Arcuri, with the Army General Francesco Paolo Figliuolo, who received the additional mandate of reorganising and implementing the vaccination campaign. Borrelli and Arcuri had both been considered close to former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.Following discussions with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Draghi announced that he had agreed to ensure vaccines produced in Italy were prioritised for distribution to the population of the European Union. On the following day, Draghi made international headlines by authorising the blocking of a shipment of 250,000 Oxford\u2013AstraZeneca vaccines that were originally intended to travel to Australia. This led to harsh criticism by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Conversely, Draghi's decision was praised by other European leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron. In mid-March, the Italian Government announced it would pause the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, after reports that some Italians treated with it had developed blood clots, although no death cases have been reported directly due to the vaccine. \nOn 16 March 2021, Draghi had a phone call with the French President Macron concerning the suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine and of the eventual decisions of the European Medicines Agency that will take a definitive decision on 18 March 2021.On 15 March 2021, Draghi placed the majority of Italy under so-called 'full lockdown' conditions, with non-essential businesses closing and travel restricted, in response to an increase in the transmission of COVID-19, although unlike the 2020 lockdown, factories and some other workplaces were allowed to remain open. Announcing the lockdown, Draghi vowed that Italy would see its vaccination programme triple in April, reaching 500,000 people per day by that time. Around this time, Draghi's approval rating as Prime Minister reached a new high of 63% in opinion polls.On 16 April, during a press conference with his health minister Roberto Speranza, Draghi announced that restrictions will be eased from 26 April, allowing the reopening of bars and restaurants, stating that \"it is possible to look to the future with prudent optimism and confidence\".In June 2021, the more contagious SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant in Italy. To contain the spread of new variants, in August 2021 the government extended the requirement of the EU Digital COVID Certificate, also known as \"Green Pass\", to the participation in sports events and music festivals, but also to the access to indoor places like bars, restaurants and gyms, as well as to long-distance public transportation. On 15 October, Italy became the first country in the world to establish a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate or a negative test, for the entire work force, public and private. On 24 November, Draghi announced the introduction of COVID-19 vaccination certificate for all the recreational activities, like cinemas, bars, restaurants and sport games, thus eliminating the possibility of attending one of these activities with a negative test only.On 5 January 2022, amid a new increase in COVID-19 cases following the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant, the government introduced compulsory vaccination for all Italian citizens above the age of 50.",
        "Domestic reforms": "In July and August, Draghi led the process to overhaul Italy's criminal and civil justice system, with an aim of reducing the time taken to resolve cases. Among other things, the reform package abolished one of the two levels of appeal applied to most cases in the Italian judiciary. The reforms had long been argued for by several political parties, on the basis that the slow legal system disincentivised external investment into Italy. On 3 August 2021, the package of reforms passed the Italian Parliament after Draghi announced that he would consider the vote a question of confidence in his government. Draghi also announced that the passage of judicial overhaul would be linked to the allocation of \u20ac200bn in post-pandemic stimulus funds from the European Union. The judicial overhaul represented the first successful reform package of the Italian justice system in several decades.In October 2021, the Draghi Government passed its budget for 2022. The budget modified the pension reform approved by the Conte Government, known as Quota 100, which enabled retirement at age 62 with 38 years of contributions, introducing instead the so-called Quota 102 (which allows retirement at age 64 with 38 years of contributions). Italian trade unions opposed the reform and organised a general strike in protest in late November and early December 2021. The Draghi government's budget also modified the citizens' income, a universal basic income introduced by Conte. The new income introduces a gradual decline in the allowance after six months and its revocation after two rejected job offers.On 30 December 2021, Draghi oversaw passage of an additional budget proposal, including an overhaul of the Italian taxation system, the introduction of a new series of tax credits and wide-ranging company tax cuts, subsidies for firms that hire young people and new mothers, subsidised mortgages for people buying their first property, and a fund set aside in order to mitigate rising energy prices. At the end of 2021, the Economist magazine named Italy as its 'Country of the Year', awarded each year to the country judged to have made the most improvement over the course of one year. The magazine singled out Draghi's leadership as central to the decision.In the 2022 presidential election, Draghi was widely seen as a probable successor of incumbent president Sergio Mattarella. However, on 29 January 2022, Draghi publicly supported the re-election of Mattarella as president, ending media speculation that he himself could succeed Mattarella, and pledged to oversee an overhaul of Italian competition law and public procurement policy in the following six months, with a view to increase the performance of the economy.On 18 February 2022, amid the global energy crisis, the Draghi Government approved a package of \u20ac8bn euro to support the economy, heavily affected by the rise of energy costs.",
        "Foreign policies": "Since the beginning of his premiership, Draghi implemented an active foreign policy focused on the Mediterranean Sea, North Africa and the Middle East in order to increase Italy's influence over the area. On 6 April 2021, Draghi visited Libya, in his first international trip, during which he met Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, saying he wanted to strengthen ties with the Arab country, a former colony of Italy. The trip was described as an attempt to reduce the Turkish and Egyptian influences over Libya, following the aftermath of the civil war. Days later, Draghi publicly labelled Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan as a \"dictator\", harshly criticising him for his behaviour after a meeting with European leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, during which, according to Draghi, he \"humiliated President von der Leyen\". The statement caused immediate reactions from the Turkish government. Turkey's foreign minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu summoned Italian ambassador and described Draghi's words as an \"unacceptable populist rhetoric\", while many other prominent members of Erdo\u011fan's cabinet strongly attacked Draghi. However, Draghi was backed by several European leaders, including the head of the European People's Party, Manfred Weber. On 14 April, Erdo\u011fan accused Draghi of being an \"appointed and unelected Prime Minister\", describing his statement as \"rude and impertinent\".\n\nIn June 2021, Draghi attended his first G7 summit in Cornwall in the United Kingdom. During the meeting, Draghi led discussions on strategy for avoiding adverse market reactions to stimulus spending. During the summit, Draghi held a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden. Draghi praised Biden, saying he had improved relations between the European Union and the United States.In August 2021, following the withdrawal of NATO troops from Afghanistan amid the Taliban offensive, the Italian government took part in the evacuation from Kabul. Within the Operation \"Aquila Omnia\", nearly 5,000 Afghans were evacuated by the Italian Armed Forces and brought to Italy.On 30 and 31 October 2021, Rome hosted the annual G20 summit. Draghi and the other leaders mainly discussed climate change, COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic global recovery in health, economic and political terms. The only leaders who did not attend the G20 were the Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.On 26 November 2021, Draghi signed the \"Quirinal Treaty\", with the French president Emmanuel Macron, at the Quirinal Palace, in Rome. The treaty is aimed to promote the convergence and coordination of French and Italian positions in matters of European and foreign policies, security and defence, migration policy, economy, education, research, culture and cross-border cooperation.\n\nUnder Draghi's premiership, a new approach toward Russia was implemented; the new Italian foreign policies was described by the Financial Times as \"one of the biggest foreign policy shifts in years\". On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine; Draghi harshly condemned Russia's attack, calling for an immediate ceasefire and promising \"whatever it takes to restore Ukrainian sovereignty\". He added that it was \"impossible to have meaningful dialogue with Moscow\", demanding Russia to unconditionally pull its forces back to the internationally established borders. Despite initial reluctance, on 26 February, during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Draghi agreed to support the exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT network, the international financial transactions system. On 22 March, Draghi broke with other European leaders when he publicly supported the application of Ukraine to join the European Union. Draghi was also among the main proponents of the freezing of a large part of Russian Central Bank's 643 billion dollars of foreign currency reserves.As of May 2022, the Italian government allocated 500 million euros to support Ukrainians arriving in Italy and 110 million in financial assistance for the Ukrainian government. Moreover, Italy sent also military equipment to Ukraine. On 3 May 2022, Draghi addressed the European Parliament dealing with several themes. According to Draghi, the EU needed to embrace \"pragmatic federalism\" in multiple policy sectors, like security, economy and defence.On 16 June 2022, Draghi visited Kyiv alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The three leaders had a long meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss various issues such as Ukraine's application to be an EU member and the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine. The trip was considered \"historic\" by various commentators.",
        "Resignation": "On 13 July 2022, after months of tensions regarding economic policies implemented by the government as well as the military response to the war in Ukraine, Giuseppe Conte, leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S) and former prime minister, revoked the support to the government on the so-called decreto aiuti (English: decree on economic aid), concerning economic stimulus to contrast the ongoing economic and energy crisis, opening a political crisis within the majority. On the following day, the Senate approved the decree with 172 votes, but the M5S abstained, leaving the Senate floor. After a few hours, following a meeting with president Mattarella, Draghi officially announced his resignation as prime minister, stating that \"the pact of trust and confidence underlying the government action had failed.\" However, the resignation was rejected by Mattarella, who invited Draghi to explain the political situation to the Parliament on 20 July.On 20 July, Draghi held a speech in front of the Senate, harshly condemning the positions that M5S and Lega held during the last months of the cabinet. In the evening, the government failed to reach the absolute majority in the confidence vote as Lega, FI and M5S decided not to take part in the ballot, de facto causing the fall of the government. On the following day, after a speech in front of the Chamber of Deputies, Draghi officially resigned as prime minister. Mattarella accepted his resignation, but Draghi remained in office as caretaker prime minister, until the formation of a new government following the 2022 general election.",
        "Personal life": "In 1973, Mario Draghi married Maria Serenella Cappello, of noble origins and descendant of Bianca Cappello, and an expert in English literature, with whom he has two children: Federica, who worked as investment director of Genextra Spa and board member of Italian Angels for Biotechis, and Giacomo, a finance analyst, who worked as an interest-rate derivative trader at investment bank Morgan Stanley until 2017, and is now at the LMR Partners hedge fund.Draghi is a Catholic of Jesuit education and is devoted to St. Ignatius of Loyola. Draghi has homes in Rome's Parioli district and in Citt\u00e0 della Pieve in Umbria. He is a supporter of A.S. Roma, one of the football teams of his hometown, and a great fan of basketball.

        "Early life and education": "Dubno was born in Brooklyn, New York.  His family moved to the Bronx where he attended the Bronx High School of Science.  In the 1970s, very few high schools and individuals had computers. Bronx Science had an IBM 1620 and an HP 2000E computer but no formal programming classes.  Dubno taught himself how to program on the school computers, nearby Lehman College's IBM System/360 (until it was stolen in 1978), and his own North Star Horizon computer.He attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1981 and left in his freshman year.Dubno founded Megasoft in 1982 and released the video game Megalegs, for Atari computers.\nStarting in 1984, he designed and built a robot that talked, moved, had a working arm, navigated using sonar, and had an infrared GPS-like location system.\nHe maintains a unique workshop in his Manhattan townhouse.",

He was the first person hired in the front office specifically for his programming skills.  In the firm's Equity division, he developed trading systems and utilities used throughout the firm.",
        "SecDB": "In 1991 he moved from Goldman's J. Aron currency and commodity division. He started SecDB (Securities DataBase) in 1992 to handle storing the rapid growth of new, non-standard, non-listed options in the currencies and metals businesses (interestingly, none of these are \"securities\", but Dubno, coming from equities, didn't know that at the time).  Each new type of option required new and different fields to describe them contractually and mathematically, and unlike SQL, SecDB was object oriented, and designed for the task.  SecServ, the underlying home-grown datastore was a cross between an immutable ledger (think blockchain) and an object store for rapid retrieval.  SecServ was unique, at the time, because it supported replication around the globe (necessary for currency trading) and each local copy was a \"master\".SecDB was then applied to calculating risk on the old and new types of contracts.  Kevin Lundeen and Glenn Gribble joined Dubno in 1993/1994 and together they created Slang (Securities LANGuage), an interpreted language to accelerate reporting and adding new objects.  Slang is similar to today's Python programming language.  As of 2017, Goldman supports over 15 to 40 million lines of Slang.Over time, SecDB and Slang were deployed in Goldman's other trading businesses (Equities and Fixed Income), becoming the primary risk system for the company.  Goldman's operating culture around the application and use of the system helped \"Goldman Sachs pioneer the tech-integrated trading business with the first roll-out of SecDB...\"SecDB played an important role in protecting and potentially \"saving Goldman Sachs\" due to the firm's substantially better risk handling before, and during, the Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. The Wall Street Journal wrote a brief article describing how SecDB works.Gary Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs, referred to SecDB as \"such a competitive advantage\".  The system has also been referred to as \"Goldman's most valuable software\", Goldman's secret sauce\",  \"most valuable trading weapon\", and \"unmatched at rivals\".",

At the bank he finished the integration of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America, and launched Quartz, a system to replicate the success that Goldman Sachs had experienced with SecDB.In addition to his Global Markets and Investment Research Technology, he ran Global Markets Operations, Firmwide Risk Technology, and co-headed the Global Markets Quantitative Strategies group.

        "Introduction": "William C. Dudley (born 1953) is an American economist who served as the president of Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2009 to 2018 and as vice-chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee. He was appointed to the position on January 27, 2009, following the confirmation of his predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, as United States Secretary of the Treasury.",
        "Early life and education": "Dudley attended the Williston Northampton School in Easthampton, Massachusetts. He spent his freshman year at Columbia University and subsequently earned a B.A. degree from New College of Florida in 1974, and a PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1982.",
        "Career": "Dudley worked at Goldman Sachs from 1986 to 2007 where he held the position of chief U.S. economist. In 2007 he was hired by then-president of the New York Federal Reserve Timothy Geithner to oversee the department in charge of buying and selling government securities. When Timothy Geithner became the Secretary of Treasury in 2009, Dudley became the 10th President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \nIn 2019, Dudley joined the Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies at Princeton University as a senior research scholar.  He is currently the Chair of the Bretton Woods Committee.  He is a member of the Group of Thirty and the Council on Foreign Relations. He was a member of the Bank for International Settlements Board of Directors from 2009 to 2018 and chaired the BIS Committee on Payment Settlement Systems (2009-2012) and the Committee on the Global Financial System (2012-2018).\nDudley worked closely with Chairman Bernanke, Chair Yellen, and Chairman Powell as Vice-Chairman of the FOMC during 2009\u20132018.",
        "Economic views": "Dudley pioneered the importance of financial conditions in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  He also led an effort by the NY Fed to highlight the importance of improving culture and conduct in the financial services industry.  He has stressed the importance of incentives.  Incentives drive conduct and behavior and this helps establish the social norms that define culture.\nIn 2002, Dudley wrote the Federal Reserve should have \"tightened policy earlier and more aggressively during the 1996-1999 period\", with the hope that the downward forces would not have been so intense after the collapse of the stock market that began in 2000.Dudley was criticized for remarks over food inflation in 2011 when he argued that you have to look at all prices when looking at inflation.  He noted that some prices like the iPad were effectively falling as the next generation was twice as powerful at the same price. A member of the crowd shouted \"I can't eat an iPad\".When asked about the drop in the stock market on February 8, 2018, Dudley said, \"So far, I'd say this is small potatoes.\"In December 2020, Dudley noted that an inflation scare was likely. Base effects and supply chain disruptions were likely to push inflation well above 2%.  Dudley also highlighted the flaws in the Fed\u2019s new long-term monetary framework, pointing out that how the Fed operationalized its new 2% average inflation targeting regime meant that it would be slow to tighten monetary policy.  The likely result would be the Fed forced to respond more aggressively later, resulting in higher short-term rates and, ultimately, a greater risk of a hard landing and recession.",

    "Rahm Emanuel": {
        "Introduction": "Rahm Israel Emanuel (; born November 29, 1959) is an American politician and diplomat. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served two terms as the 55th mayor of Chicago from 2011 to 2019 and the 23rd White House Chief of Staff from 2009 to 2010, and served three terms in the United States House of Representatives, representing Illinois between 2003 and 2009. He is the current United States ambassador to Japan.\nBorn in Chicago, Emanuel is a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College and Northwestern University. Early in his career, Emanuel served as director of the finance committee for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. In 1993, he joined the Clinton administration, where he served as assistant to the president for political affairs and as Senior Advisor to the President for policy and strategy. Emanuel worked at the investment bank Wasserstein Perella & Co. from 1998 for two and a half years and served on the board of directors of Freddie Mac. In 2002, Emanuel ran for the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives vacated by Rod Blagojevich, who resigned to become governor of Illinois. Emanuel won the first of three terms representing Illinois's 5th congressional district, a seat he held from 2003 to 2009. As chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he oversaw Democratic wins in the 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, allowing the party to gain control of the chamber for the first time since 1994.\nAfter the 2008 U.S. presidential election, President Barack Obama appointed Emanuel to serve as White House chief of staff. In October 2010, Emanuel resigned as chief of staff to run in the 2011 Chicago mayoral election. Emanuel won with 55% of the vote over five other candidates in the non-partisan mayoral election. In the 2015 Chicago mayoral election, he failed to obtain an absolute majority in the first round but defeated Cook County board commissioner Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda in the subsequent run-off election. In late 2015, Emanuel's approval rating plunged to \"the low 20s\", in response to a series of scandals.In October 2017, Emanuel announced he planned to run for a third term, but he reversed his decision on September 4, 2018. The Chicago Tribune assessed Emanuel's performance as mayor as \"mixed\", and at one point half of Chicagoans favored Emanuel's resignation. He left office in May 2019 and was succeeded by Lori Lightfoot. In August 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Emanuel to be the United States Ambassador to Japan; he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in December of that year.",
        "Early life and family": "Emanuel's paternal grandfather was a Moldovan Jew who emigrated from Bessarabia. The surname Emanuel (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc), which means \"God is with us\", was adopted by their family in honor of Rahm's uncle (his father's brother) Emanuel Auerbach, who was killed in 1933 in an altercation with Arabs in Jerusalem.Emanuel's father, Benjamin M. Emanuel, was a Jerusalem-born pediatrician at Michael Reese Hospital who was once a member of the Irgun, a Jewish paramilitary organization that operated in Mandatory Palestine. His mother, Marsha (n\u00e9e Smulevitz), is the daughter of a West Side Chicago labor union organizer who worked in the civil rights movement. She briefly owned a local rock and roll club, and later became an adherent of Benjamin Spock's writings. Emanuel's parents met during the 1950s in Chicago.Emanuel was born on November 29, 1959, in Chicago, Illinois. His first name, Rahm (\u05e8\u05dd\u200e) means high or lofty in Hebrew. He attended Bernard Zell Anshe Emet Day School in Lakeview for elementary school. He has been described by his older brother Ezekiel, an oncologist and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, as \"quiet and observant\" as a child. Ari, his younger brother, is the CEO of Endeavor, an entertainment agency with headquarters in Beverly Hills, California. Rahm Emanuel also has a younger adopted sister, Shoshana.",
        "Education and ballet dance": "While he lived in Chicago, Emanuel attended the Bernard Zell Anshe Emet Day School. After his family moved to Wilmette, north of the city, Emanuel attended public schools: Romona School, Locust Junior High School, and New Trier High School. He and his brothers attended summer camp in Israel, including the summer following the June 1967 Six-Day War. Ezekiel has written that their father \"did not believe in falsely building his sons' self-esteem by purposefully letting us win, or tolerating sloppy play\". About Rahm, he also wrote:\n\nThough fiercely intelligent ... he was not naturally inclined to sit at a desk and put in extra effort to turn a B into an A. As my father often said, without noting that the phrase applied to himself at that same age, \"Rahm always tries to get the maximum for the minimum.\"\nRahm was encouraged by his mother to take ballet lessons, and is a graduate of the Evanston School of Ballet, as well as a student of The Joel Hall Dance Center, where his children later took lessons. He won a scholarship to the Joffrey Ballet, but turned it down to attend Sarah Lawrence College, a liberal arts school with a strong dance program. This background, as well as the mayor's short stature, has led critics of the Mayor to nickname him \"tiny dancer\". While an undergraduate, Emanuel was elected to the Sarah Lawrence Student Senate. He graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts, and went on to receive a Master of Arts in Speech and Communication from Northwestern University in 1985.Emanuel took part in a two-week civilian volunteer holiday, known as the Sar-El, where, as a civilian volunteer, he assisted the Israel Defense Forces during the 1991 Gulf War, helping to repair truck brakes in one of Israel's northern bases.While a high school student working part-time at an Arby's restaurant, Emanuel severely cut his right middle finger on a meat slicer, which was later infected from swimming in Lake Michigan. His finger was partially amputated due to the severity of the infection.",
        "Political staffer career": "Emanuel began his political career with the public interest and consumer rights organization Illinois Public Action. He went on to serve in a number of capacities in local and national politics, initially specializing in fund-raising for Illinois campaigns, and then nationally.Emanuel worked for Democrat Paul Simon's 1984 election to the U.S. Senate. He also worked as the national campaign director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 1988, and was senior advisor and chief fund-raiser for Richard M. Daley's successful initial campaign for mayor of Chicago, in 1989.At the start of then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's presidential primary campaign, Emanuel was appointed to direct the campaign's finance committee. Emanuel insisted that Clinton schedule time for fund-raising and delay campaigning in New Hampshire. Clinton embarked on an aggressive national fund-raising campaign that allowed the campaign to keep buying television time as attacks on Clinton's character threatened to swamp the campaign during the New Hampshire primary. Clinton's primary rival, Paul Tsongas (the New Hampshire Democratic primary winner), later withdrew, citing a lack of campaign funds. Richard Mintz, a Washington public relations consultant who worked with Emanuel on the campaign, spoke about the soundness of the idea: \"It was that [extra] million dollars that really allowed the campaign to withstand the storm we had to ride out in New Hampshire [over Clinton's relationship with Gennifer Flowers and the controversy over his draft status during the Vietnam War].\" Emanuel's knowledge of the top donors in the country, and his rapport with \"heavily Jewish\" donors helped Clinton amass a then-unheard-of sum of $72 million. While working on the Clinton campaign Emanuel was a paid retainer of the investment bank Goldman Sachs.",
        "Clinton administration": "Following the campaign, Emanuel served as a senior advisor to Clinton at the White House from 1993 to 1998. In the White House, Emanuel was initially Assistant to the President for Political Affairs and then Senior Advisor to the President for Policy and Strategy. He was a leading strategist in White House efforts to institute NAFTA, among other Clinton initiatives.Emanuel is known for his \"take-no-prisoners style\" that has earned him the nickname \"Rahmbo\". Emanuel sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster who was late delivering polling results. On the night after the 1992 election, angry at Democrats and Republicans who \"betrayed\" them in the 1992 election, Emanuel stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign and began plunging a steak knife into the table and began rattling off names while shouting \"Dead! Dead! Dead!\". Before Tony Blair gave a pro-Clinton speech during the impeachment crisis, Emanuel reportedly screamed at Blair \"Don't fuck this up!\" while Clinton was present. Blair and Clinton both burst into laughter. However, by 2007 friends of Emanuel were saying that he has \"mellowed out\". Stories of his personal style have entered the popular culture, inspiring articles and websites that chronicle these and other quotes and incidents. The character Josh Lyman in The West Wing was said to be based on Emanuel, though executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell denied this.",
        "Career in finance": "After serving as an advisor to Bill Clinton, in 1998 Emanuel resigned from his position in the administration and joined the investment banking firm Wasserstein Perella, where he worked for 2+1\u20442 years. Although he did not have an MBA degree or prior banking experience, he became a managing director at the firm's Chicago office in 1999, and according to congressional disclosures, made $16.2 million in his 2+1\u20442 years as a banker. At Wasserstein Perella, he worked on eight deals, including the acquisition by Commonwealth Edison of Peco Energy and the purchase by GTCR Golder Rauner of the SecurityLink home security unit from SBC Communications.",
        "Freddie Mac": "In 2000, Emanuel was named to the Board of Directors of Freddie Mac by President Clinton. He earned at least $320,000 during his time there, including later stock sales. During Emanuel's time on the board, Freddie Mac was plagued with scandals involving campaign contributions and accounting irregularities. The Bush administration rejected a request under the Freedom of Information Act to review Freddie Mac board minutes and correspondence during Emanuel's time as a director. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight later accused the board of having \"failed in its duty to follow up on matters brought to its attention\". Emanuel resigned from the board in 2001 before his first bid for Congress.",
        "Congressional career": "No information",
        "Elections": "No information",
        "Tenure": "Emanuel assembled a transition team from varied backgrounds. On November 16, the city council voted unanimously to adopt the mayor's first budget, which decreased the budget by $34 million and increased spending by $46.2 million, supported by increasing fees and fines. Despite most Aldermen opposing cuts to library workers and the closure of mental health clinics, they ultimately supported it, calling it \"honest\". At a news conference in November 2012, Emanuel listed his top three priorities for the state legislature as security and pension reform, adding a casino to Chicago, and equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. At a press conference with then Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, who previously vetoed legislation to put a casino in Chicago, the two were \"very close\" to reaching a deal.In April 2018, Emanuel received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from NUI Galway, a university in Chicago's sister city of Galway, Ireland, with the conferrers citing achievements in education reform while Mayor.During Emanuel's time as mayor of Chicago, two of Emanuel's appointees, Barbara Byrd-Bennett and Amer Ahmad, were convicted of corruption charges. A third appointee, Forrest Claypool, resigned after the inspector general accused him of a cover up. Emanuel received backlash for defending him against the accusations.",
        "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman": "Emanuel assumed the position of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman (DCCC) after the death of the previous chair, Bob Matsui. Emanuel led the Democratic Party's effort to capture the majority in the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections. The documentary HouseQuake, featuring Emanuel, chronicles those elections. Emanuel had disagreements over Democratic election strategy with Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean. Dean favored a \"fifty-state strategy\", building support for the Democratic Party over the long term, while Emanuel advocated a more tactical approach focusing attention on key districts.\n\nThe Democratic Party gained 30 seats in the House in the 2006 elections, and Emanuel received considerable praise for his stewardship of the DCCC, even from Illinois Republican Rep. Ray LaHood, who said, \"He legitimately can be called the golden boy of the Democratic Party today. He recruited the right candidates, found the money, and funded them, and provided issues for them. Rahm did what no one else could do in seven cycles.\"However, Emanuel also faced some criticism for his failure to support some progressive candidates, as Howard Dean advocated. Emanuel had \"aggressively recruited right-leaning candidates, frequently military veterans, including former Republicans\". Many of the Representatives that Rahm had recruited, such as Heath Shuler, ended up \"[voting] against important Obama administration priorities, like economic stimulus, banking reform, and health care\". Howie Klein has suggested that Emanuel's congressional campaign strategy was short-sighted, as it \"contributed to the massive G.O.P. majorities we have now, the biggest since the nineteen-twenties\" when the Democrats lost control of the House in the 2010 mid-term elections.After Emanuel's election as chairman of the Democratic Caucus (see below), Chris Van Hollen became committee chair for the 110th Congress.",
        "Democratic Caucus chairman": "After his role in helping the Democrats win the 2006 elections, Emanuel was believed to be a leading candidate for the position of Majority Whip. Nancy Pelosi, who became the next Speaker of the House of Representatives, persuaded him not to challenge Jim Clyburn, but instead to succeed Clyburn in the role of Democratic Caucus Chairman. In return, Pelosi agreed to assign the caucus chair more responsibilities, including \"aspects of strategy and messaging, incumbent retention, policy development, and rapid-response communications\". Caucus vice-chair John Larson remained in his role instead of running for the chairman position.After Vice President Dick Cheney asserted that he did not fall within the bounds of orders set for the executive branch, Emanuel called for cutting off the $4.8 million the Executive Branch provides for the Vice President's office.",
        "Positions on political issues": "Social issuesEmanuel is generally liberal on social issues. He has maintained a 100-percent pro-choice voting record, supports LGBT rights including same-sex marriage, and is a strong supporter of gun control, rated \"F\" by the NRA in December 2003. He has also strongly supported the banning of numerous rifles based upon \"sporting purposes\" criteria.During his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel spoke in support of the goal of \"to help make health care affordable and available for all Americans\".In his 2006 book, co-authored with Bruce Reed, The Plan: Big Ideas for America, Emanuel advocated a three-month compulsory universal service program for Americans between the ages of 18 and 25. A similar, expanded version of the initiative was later proposed by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nIraq warDuring his original 2002 campaign, Emanuel \"indicated his support of President Bush's position on Iraq, but said he believed the President needed to better articulate his position to the American people\".In the 2006 congressional primaries, Emanuel, then head of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, helped organize a run by Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran with no political experience, against grassroots candidate Christine Cegelis in Illinois' 6th district. Expedited withdrawal from Iraq was a central point of Cegelis' campaign and Duckworth opposed a withdrawal timetable.\nMiddle EastIn June 2007, Emanuel condemned an outbreak of Palestinian violence in the Gaza Strip and criticized Arab countries for not applying the same kind of pressure on the Palestinians as they have on Israel. At a 2003 pro-Israel rally in Chicago, Emanuel told the marchers that Israel was \"ready for peace\" but would not get there until Palestinians \"turn away from the path of terror\".",
        "White House Chief of Staff": "Emanuel declared in April 2006 that he would support Hillary Clinton should she pursue the presidency in 2008. Emanuel remained close to Clinton since leaving the White House, talking strategy with her at least once a month as chairman of the DCCC. However, Emanuel's loyalties came into conflict when his home-state Senator, Barack Obama, expressed interest in the race. Asked in January 2007, about his stance on the Democratic presidential nomination, he said: \"I'm hiding under the desk. I'm very far under the desk, and I'm bringing my paper and my phone.\" Emanuel remained neutral in the race until June 4, 2008, the day after the final primary contests, when he endorsed Obama.\n\nOn November 6, 2008, Emanuel accepted the position of White House Chief of Staff for US President Barack Obama. He resigned his congressional seat effective January 2, 2009. A special primary to fill his vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7. John Fritchey, a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel had told him he may be interested in running for the seat again in the future.Some Republican leaders criticized Emanuel's appointment because they believed it went against Obama's campaign promises of less divisive politics, given Emanuel's reputation as a partisan Democrat. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham disagreed, saying: \"This is a wise choice by President-elect Obama. He's tough, but fair, honest, direct, and candid.\" Ira Forman, executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, said that the choice indicated that Obama would not listen to the \"wrong people\" regarding the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship. Some commentators opined that Emanuel would be good for the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process because if Israeli leaders made excuses for not dismantling settlements, Emanuel would be tough and pressure the Israelis to comply. Some Palestinians expressed dismay at Emanuel's appointment.Weeks after accepting the appointment, Emanuel participated on a panel of corporate chief executive officers sponsored by the Wall Street Journal, and said, \"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\" Emanuel explained later, \"... what I said was, never allow a good crisis to go to waste when it's an opportunity to do things that you had never considered, or that you didn't think were possible.\"In a 2009 article in The New York Times, Emanuel was characterized as being \"perhaps the most influential chief of staff of a generation\".He has a reputation for his no-holds-barred negotiation style that involves \"his share of shouting and cursing\". Ezekiel Emanuel has written, \"The impatient, pushy Emanuel style is so well known that during a recent job interview I was asked, point-blank, whether I had the level-headed temperament the position required. ... . [A]s obvious as our flaws are to others, it's difficult to recognize them in ourselves.\" At a January 2010 closed-door meeting in the White House with liberal activists, Emanuel called them \"fucking retarded\" for planning to run TV ads attacking conservative Democrats who didn't support Obama's health-care overhaul. After the remarks were quoted in a front-page story of the Wall Street Journal, and after he was criticized by Sarah Palin, Emanuel apologized to organizations for the mentally handicapped for using the word \"retarded\".According to Jonathan Alter's book, The Promise, Emanuel opposed Barack Obama's plan for a broad health care reform, but Obama overrode him. Emanuel advocated a smaller plan because it could get bi-partisan support. Emanuel wanted to expand coverage for children, and increase the number of single mothers eligible for Medicaid. For that reason, it was dubbed \"the Titanic plan\", a reference to the priority given to saving women and children during the sinking of the Titanic. Reportedly, House Speaker Pelosi had to convince Obama on the health care initiative after Emanuel dramatically scaled it back. Emanuel has since apologized for his role, saying, \"Thank God for the country, he didn't listen to me\", after the Supreme Court upheld \"ObamaCare\" in 2012.As chief of staff, Emanuel would make his staff laugh. During a staff meeting, when Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra gave uniformly upbeat reports, Emanuel is said to have looked at him and said: \"Whatever you're taking, I want some.\" Emanuel had a hand in war strategy, political maneuvering, communications and economic policy. Bob Woodward wrote in Obama's Wars that Emanuel made a habit of telephoning CIA Director Leon Panetta and asking about the lethal drone strikes aimed at Al Qaeda, asking, \"Who did we get today?\".In 2010, Emanuel was reported to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in mid-term elections, this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.",
        "Mayor of Chicago": "No information",
        "2011": "On September 30, 2010, it was announced that Emanuel would leave his post as White House Chief of Staff to run for Mayor of Chicago. He was replaced by Pete Rouse on October 2, 2010.\nEmanuel entered the race with high-name recognition, having not only a sizeable local profile, but a sizable national profile.Emanuel's eligibility for office was challenged on the basis of his lack of residency in Chicago for one year prior to the election. This was the period when Emanuel was in Washington serving as the White House chief of staff. The Board of Elections and the Cook County Circuit Court affirmed his eligibility. A divided Court of Appeals reversed the Circuit Court, holding on January 24, 2011, that residency for purposes of a candidate is different from residency for purposes of being a voter. A further appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court resulted in a unanimous decision reversing the Court of Appeals and affirming Emanuel's eligibility.In the race, Emanuel had a financial advantage over the other candidates. He was by far the best-financed candidate, with more than three times the campaign funds as the second-best financed candidate (Gery Chico), and more than twenty-times the third-best financed candidate (Carol Moseley Braun). Emanuel's had his financial advantage from the very start of his candidacy, as he began his campaign with approximately $1.2 million from his congressional campaign fund. By December 31, 2010 he had raised more than $10.5 million in additional funds. On January 1, 2011 the Illinois Campaign Disclosure Act took effect, limiting individual personal contributions to candidates to $5,000. Nevertheless, he continued to raise substantial funds, ultimately having procured a total $15 million over the course of his campaign (including those funds transferred from his congressional campaign committee. Emanuel was able to raise so much because he had experience fundraising, had built a Washington connections and a national profile, and his brother Ari had Hollywood connections. He had 75 contributors give more than $50,000, twenty-five of which were from out of state. Among these high-dollar contributors were Steven Spielberg, Donald Trump, and Steve Jobs. Despite having a national fundraising operation, three-quarters of his donations came locally. More than $800,000 of his contributions were from financial exchange and trading executives, with his largest single donation being a $200,000 donation from executives of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.Emanuel proposed lowering the city's sales tax and raising the service tax. Emanuel supported negotiating with the Chicago Teachers Union for longer school days and school years. Emanuel opposed instituting an elected school board.  This received criticism from other candidates.Other candidates assailed his tenure at Freddie Mac.As the frontrunner, Emanuel had gotten more press coverage than other mayoral candidates. This was furthered by the fact that the challenge to his residency became a dominant headline.Emanuel entered the race with solid backing from North and Northwest Side Democratic Ward Committeemen.Emanuel's advertisements showed portrayed him as having strong roots in the city, and, in telling his biography, emphasized his upbringing on the North Shore. Contrarily, Emanuel's opponents attempted to characterize him as a carpetbagger, hailing not from the city itself but rather from the North Shore and Washington, D.C. Emanuel's advertisements also sought to emphasize his tenures in working in the White House and his tenure as a congressman. Emanuel would highlight his relations with presidents Clinton and Obama. He also sought to highlight the fact that he had forged connections in Washington during his time in congress, and also had strong business ties.Emanuel had overwhelming support from Jewish and LGBT voters. Emanuel held a lead with independent progressives, including strong support from the lakefront liberals voting bloc of wealthy white progressives from the city's northern lakefront. As the only white candidate in the race, Emanuel was seen as likely to receive unified support from a majority of the white electorate. Since the hispanic vote was largely split between two hispanic candidates (Gery Chico and Miguel del Valle), once Emanuel was able to secure the support of the majority of the black vote, he had secured himself victory.In attracting African American voters to his candidacy, Emanuel was helped by his associations with Presidents Clinton and Obama, both of whom were extremely popular among the African American community. After Moseley Braun's support began to crater following a character attack on fellow candidate Patricia Van Pelt Watkins which backfired, Emanuel was the beneficiary as the, largely African American, voters that abandoned their support of Moseley Braun's candidacy primarily migrated to support his candidacy. Once this happened, Emanuel had all but secured himself a first-place finish, and the remaining candidates were left to jockey for second-place in hopes of there being a runoff.Emanuel carried the endorsements of both the city's major daily newspapers, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times.Emanuel's mayoral campaign was the inspiration for a satirical Twitter account called MayorEmanuel, which received more than 43,000 followers, more popular than Emanuel's actual Twitter account. Emanuel announced on February 28 that if the author would reveal himself, he would donate $5,000 to the charity of the author's choice. When Chicago journalist Dan Sinker revealed himself, Emanuel donated the money to Young Chicago Authors, a community organization which helps young people with writing and publishing skills.\n\nEmanuel was elected on February 22, 2011, with 55% of the vote, and was sworn in as the 55th Mayor of Chicago on May 16, 2011, at the Pritzker Pavilion. At his inauguration were outgoing Mayor Richard M. Daley, Vice President Joe Biden, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, former Mayor Jane Byrne, and William M. Daley, brother of the outgoing mayor and who would later serve as White House Chief of Staff. Emanuel was Chicago's first Jewish mayor.",
        "2015": "An August 2014, Chicago Tribune poll reported Emanuel had a 35% approval rating as mayor of Chicago.In 2015, Emanuel won 56 percent of the vote in the run-off election against Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda held on April 7, 2015. He had been hurt by sharp neighborhood criticism of his decision to shut down 50 public schools in black and Latino neighborhoods, and his installation of red light cameras, together with anger at the high level of gun violence on the streets. On the other hand, he was supported by the business community and most elements of the Democratic party.",
        "2019": "Emanuel announced in October 2017 that he was running for reelection in 2019, despite low approval ratings and some potentially serious challengers. In September 2018, Emanuel then announced he would not run for reelection as previously announced. Close friend David Axelrod told USA Today that Emanuel had grown uncertain about his devotion to a third term. Emanuel had been leading in the polls prior to his decision to withdraw. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Emanuel stated that he had been conferring with his wife and children for months before announcing the decision and that he felt it was time to \"write the next chapter.\"",
        "Aldermanic appointments": "As mayor, Emanuel appointed several individuals to fill vacancies on the Chicago City Council. This included appointing Natashia Holmes as 7th Ward alderman in 2013, Deb Mell as 33rd Ward alderman in 2013, Sophia King as 4th ward alderman in 2016, and Silvana Tabares as 23rd Ward alderman in 2018.Following the resignation of Willie Cochran in March 2019, Emanuel had the opportunity to make a final aldermanic appointment, appointing an interim alderman to hold the seat until his successor (to be elected in an April 2 runoff) would assume office on May 20. However, Emanuel did not make such an appointment, leaving the seat vacant until March 20.",
        "Police and community relations": "In August 2012, a federal lawsuit was filed by eleven Chicago police officers alleging they were removed from the mayoral security detail and replaced with officers who worked on Emanuel's mayoral campaign, in violation of the 1983 Shakman Decree, which bars city officials from making political considerations in the hiring process.Rahm Emanuel faced a great deal of criticism for his handling of the October 20, 2014, police murder of Laquan McDonald. The dash-cam video of the shooting was initially withheld, and only was released after a judge ordered it on November 24, 2015. After the video release, Emanuel was condemned for covering up the incident and allowing Chicago police to use excessive force against minorities. Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass wrote that the Emanuel administration withheld from the public the police dashboard camera video of the shooting in order to secure the reelection. Emanuel responded to criticism of the shooting and how it was handled by firing police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. In early December, the federal Justice Department announced an investigation into the Chicago Police Department, a move which Emanuel initially called \"misguided\". Illinois state legislator La Shawn Ford also introduced a bill to recall the mayor (an effort most pundits claim was more symbolic than practical).Protests erupted soon after the release of the video, and on Black Friday protesters shut down part of the city's Magnificent Mile. Public calls for resignation grew steadily over this period, including a well-circulated op-ed published in The New York Times. By early December, Emanuel's approval rating had sunk to 18%, with 67% of Chicagoans disapproving of his job performance, and slightly more than half of those polled calling for his resignation. During the week of December 10, protestors blocked streets and continued to call for Emanuel to resign. Additional protests against Emanuel and Chicago's Police Department were held on the city's busy Michigan Avenue shopping area on December 24, 2015.On December 26, 2015, a police officer killed two people in another shooting, including a woman whom the officer had shot by mistake. On December 28, Emanuel announced that he was cutting short his vacation in Cuba to deal with the crisis. Emanuel announced several changes to the Chicago police department on December 30, including doubling the number of Tasers issued to officers. On New Year's Eve, the Emanuel administration released e-mails revealing they had sought to coordinate with independent agencies such as the Independent Police Review Authority regarding public relations after the shooting. The same day The New Yorker added to the wave of negative media attention surrounding the mayor by publishing \"The Sudden But Well-Deserved Fall of Rahm Emanuel\", an article critically reevaluating Emanuel's legacy as a political operative since the early 1990s.",
        "Public education": "In 2012, during the contract negotiations between the city and the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise could not be reached over issues like health insurance increases, teacher evaluations, and seniority pay increases. On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.On September 17, 2013, Emanuel's appointed Chicago Board of Education announced the closing of 50 Chicago public schools, 49 elementary schools and a high school \u2014 the largest school closure in Chicago history.The trends in dropout and graduation rates have shown considerable improvement in the last five years, but researchers point out the alternative school performance does not follow the general trend.",
        "Public health": "On August 16, 2011, Emanuel unveiled \"Healthy Chicago\", the city's first  public health blueprint with Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Bechara Choucair. Emanuel initiated the consolidation of City Council committees from 19 to 16 in a cost control effort. On October 30, 2012, Emanuel voiced his support for the demolition of the abandoned Prentice Women's Hospital Building, in order for Northwestern University, which owns the property, to build a new facility. Preservationists supported historical landmark status. Days later, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks voted that the building met landmark status criteria then reversed their decision later in the same meeting. On November 15, a judge granted a temporary stay of the decision in order for a lawsuit filed by preservation coalitions against the landmark commission to be heard.",
        "Lack of transparency": "Emanuel rejected requests under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act from The Chicago Tribune for various communication and information logs for himself and his staff, labelling it \"unduly burdensome\". After a second request by the Tribune, they were informed that 90 percent of the e-mails had been deleted by Emanuel and his top aides. As a result, Emanuel came under fire for going against his campaign promise to create \"the most open, accountable, and transparent government that the City of Chicago has ever seen\".Emanuel and his office were found guilty of breaking state law by withholding government emails by transferring them onto his personal phone.In March 2017 Chicago Tribune reported Emanuel released 2,696 emails he had previously withheld. In the emails there were found to be 26 possible violations of lobbying laws. On at least 26 occasions lobbyists, corporate executives, donors, and friends of Emanuel got access to Emanuel or other city officials without registering as a lobbyist or reporting their contact to the ethics board.",
        "Tax-exempt status of Lollapalooza": "Lollapalooza, an annual summer music festival in Grant Park, was exempt from taxation. Emanuel's brother Ari is the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor, which co-owns the event. In 2011 Rahm Emanuel asked the City Council to appoint an independent third party negotiator, to avoid having the negotiation seen as biased. Although the deal was reached before Emanuel took office, tax breaks must be negotiated every year. It was later revealed that the festival received its tax exemption for 2011 in the final days of the Daley administration. In 2012, Lollapalooza paid taxes for the first time in seven years and extended its contract to host in Grant Park through 2021.",
        "Hyperloop": "Rahm Emanuel announced preliminary plans to award Elon Musk a contract to build a Hyperloop between downtown Chicago and the city\u2019s O'Hare International Airport, although it would receive no public subsidies under this plan. However, some criticized the fact that Elon Musk has in the past donated more than $55,000 to Rahm Emanuel\u2019s various election campaigns, suggesting a potential conflict of interest between the two.",

        "Introduction": "Jonathan Faiman (born 1969) was one of the three founders of online grocery and technology business Ocado in 2000. He left the business in 2008, before the company floated on the London Stock Exchange. Faiman sold most of his shares in Ocado in 2010 at the time of its IPO for a reported value of \u00a37 million. If owned in May 2020, the shares would have been worth over \u00a3500 million.More recently, in 2018, he founded Today Development Partners, also known as TDP and T0DAY (spelled with a zero), also an online grocery business that was established to rival his former business Ocado. This business has been the subject of controversy and litigation. In July 2019,  Faiman was sued by Ocado over allegations that Faiman had colluded with Jon Hilary, then a senior Ocado employee, to steal confidential information from Ocado in order to launch T0DAY. In June 2021, the case was settled following an admission of wrongdoing by the pair and Faiman making a \"significant payment\" to Ocado. Ocado said it had recovered the confidential information and the High Court has made a permanent injunction, backed by a penal notice, preventing Faiman from using the confidential information in the future. The future of TDP is unclear.",
        "Career": "Faiman worked at Goldman Sachs as a bond trader before becoming one of the three founders of Ocado in 2000. The other founders are Jason Gissing and Tim Steiner, both of whom were also Goldman Sachs employees.  Faiman left Ocado in 2008 and stepped down from the board in 2010.  Ocado is now a FTSE 100 online grocery and technology company with a market capitalisation of nearly \u00a315 billion.\nHaving left Ocado, Faiman started a wheat farming business in Ukraine. In 2015, Faiman moved to run Neos Geosolutions, a company that aimed to collect and analyse geological data to find new oil and gas reserves onshore.  Despite being backed financially by Bill Gates, Goldman Sachs and Kleiner Perkins, the business failed in 2018 and was being sued by investors until Faiman settled the case out of court.In 2018, Faiman founded T0DAY and, in May 2019, it was announced that Waitrose was in discussions with T0DAY for it to become its online retail partner after Ocado had terminated their 20-year relationship in favour of a partnership with Marks and Spencer.  However, Waitrose terminated these negotiations in July 2019 after a court search found hundreds of confidential Ocado documents in Faiman's possession, which led to Ocado suing Faiman, TDP and Jon Hillary for intellectual property theft.In March 2022, TDP entered administration, with Ocado acquiring some of the company's assets.",
        "Litigation": "In June 2019, Ocado obtained a court order for searches to be carried out the offices of T0DAY and the residences of Faiman and Jon Hilary (then a senior Ocado employee), concerned they had stolen information from Ocado. The searches found hundreds of documents including Ocado contracts, pitch documents and blueprints for an automated warehouse.  Following the search, Faiman and Hillary admitted to working together and using information about Ocado's business to pitch T0DAY\u2019s services while Hillary was still working at Ocado.  Hillary has admitted breaching his contract but Faiman denies that the stolen information was valuable to them.The case attracted substantial media coverage in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The case was settled in June 2021 following an admission of wrongdoing in an agreed statement of facts in which the defendants acknowledge that Hillary, while still employed by Ocado and at Faiman\u2019s request, provided Faiman with a \u201csignificant number\u201d of confidential documents belonging to Ocado. It was reported that Faiman made a \"significant payment\" to Ocado and covered their legal fees reported to be \u00a31.75 million.In June 2020, it was reported that Faiman is being sued by Russian industrialist and billionaire Andrey Melnichenko for unpaid debts amounting to \u00a357 million. In the High Court hearing, Faiman said that his supermarket tech business T0DAY was at risk of collapse because he could not pay the debt.In September 2020, it was reported that Faiman had had his assets frozen as a result of the dispute with Melnichenko.  Melnichenko's US lawyers requested access to Faiman's bank records saying, \"evidence is needed to trace the funds wrongly diverted by Mr Faiman and seek to freeze those funds before they disappear\"."

Flowers continued to advise Bank of America as it gave up on a Lehman acquisition and went on to acquire Merrill Lynch. Flowers's role in the crisis was portrayed by Michael O'Keefe in the 2011 HBO film Too Big to Fail.In September 2008, Flowers also purchased the First National Bank of Cainesville, a regional bank in Missouri, renaming it Flowers National Bank. Flowers sold the bank to Farmers Bank of Northern Missouri in 2016.In June 2014, Flowers completed the first public listing of a British bank on the London Stock Exchange's main market for more than a decade when he floated U.K. bank OneSavings Bank (OSB), a small business and mortgage lender he bought into in 2010. Later that year he argued that banking regulations in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis had depressed profitability so much that lenders would struggle to attract enough investors to survive the next financial crisis. In 2016, Fortune reported that he suffered heavy losses from the Brexit vote, largely as a result of private equity investments in OSB; however, by 2018, Flowers had completely exited OSB in one of the most profitable recent financial services deals.",

        "Introduction": "Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau (Dutch: Johan Friso Bernhard Christiaan David van Oranje-Nassau van Amsberg; 25 September 1968 \u2013 12 August 2013) was the younger brother of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. Prince Friso was a member of the Dutch Royal Family, but because of his marriage without an Act of Consent in 2004, he lost his membership of the Dutch Royal House and was no longer in the line of succession to the throne.\nOn 17 February 2012, Prince Friso was buried under an avalanche in Lech, Austria, while skiing off piste. He was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck, where he was in a critical but stable condition. According to his doctor, Wolfgang Koller, even though he was trapped for a relatively short time and hopes had originally been higher, subsequent neurological tests showed that after fifty minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in moderate hypothermia, he suffered massive brain damage due to oxygen shortage. His initial coma later progressed to a minimally conscious state, and it was unclear whether he would ever regain full consciousness. On 12 August 2013, one and a half years after the accident, Prince Friso died of complications.",
        "Early life and education": "Johan Friso Bernhard Christiaan David was born on 25 September 1968 at the Utrecht University Hospital (now the University Medical Center Utrecht) in Utrecht, Netherlands. He was the second son of Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus, and grandson of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard. He had one older brother, current King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands (b. 1967), and one younger brother, Prince Constantijn (b. 1969).His titles at birth were Prince of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, and Jonkheer van Amsberg. Prince Friso was baptized on 28 December 1968 in the Dom Church in Utrecht. His godparents were Prince Harald of Norway, Johan Christian Baron von Jenisch, Herman van Roijen, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Christina von Amsberg.\n\nIn 1986, he graduated from the secondary school Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum in The Hague. From 1986 until 1988, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1988 he studied at Delft University of Technology, where he obtained an engineer's degree in aeronautical engineering in 1994. From 1990 he also went to the Erasmus University Rotterdam, where he obtained an MSc degree in business economics in 1995. Subsequently he attended INSEAD (Fontainebleau, France), where he received an MBA degree in 1997.",
        "Work": "Prince Friso worked from 1995 to 1996 at the Amsterdam branch of the international management consultancy McKinsey. After completing an MBA-programme at INSEAD, Prince Friso worked from 1998 to 2003 as a vice president at Goldman Sachs International in London. In 2004, he became part-time co-president of TNO Space in Delft. From October 2006, Prince Friso was Managing Director in the London office of a private investment and advisory firm, Wolfensohn & Company.Prince Friso was a co-founder of the MRI Centre in Amsterdam and was also a founding shareholder of Wizzair, the largest low-cost airline in Eastern Europe. He was honorary chairman of the Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development (a position he held together with his younger brother, Prince Constantijn).Prior to his accident, Prince Friso was working as a chief financial officer for URENCO, a uranium enrichment company.",
        "Marriage and children": "On 30 June 2003, it was announced that Prince Friso was to marry Mabel Wisse Smit. The Dutch cabinet, however, did not seek permission from parliament for this marriage, a constitutional requirement if Prince Friso was to remain a member of the Dutch Royal House and in line of succession for the throne; at the time, he was second in line after his older brother, Willem-Alexander.\nThe Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende explained that this was due to discussions with Mabel Wisse Smit in October 2003, when she had admitted that her previous statements about an alleged relationship with Klaas Bruinsma (1953\u20131991), a known Dutch drug baron, had not been complete and accurate. She had previously stated that she had contact for a few months with Bruinsma, but in a casual context, neither intimate nor relating to business, and that she had broken the contact on learning of Bruinsma's occupation.\nThis \"breach of trust\" was the reason the government did not seek parliamentary permission, respecting the wishes of the couple. They nevertheless married at Oude Kerk (Delft) on 24 April 2004, and Mabel Wisse Smit became a member of the Dutch Royal Family but not a member of the Dutch Royal House.\nConsidering that his elder brother King Willem-Alexander has three children, Prince Friso's exclusion from the succession was unlikely to have an effect on the monarchy in the Netherlands.After their marriage, Prince Friso and his wife Princess Mabel set up home in London, in the suburb of Kew.The couple's first child, Countess Emma Luana Ninette Sophie of Orange-Nassau, Jonkvrouwe van Amsberg, was born on 26 March 2005  in London. Their younger daughter, Countess Joanna Zaria Nicoline Milou of Orange-Nassau, Jonkvrouwe van Amsberg, was born on 18 June 2006, also in London.",

According to a formal statement of the Netherlands Government Information Service (RVD), a prognosis could only be given after some days. The prince's condition was described as \"stable, but critical\".",
        "Resulting complications": "The Dutch Royal Family issued a statement on 19 February saying \"The Royal Family is very grateful and deeply touched by all expressions of support and sympathy after the ski accident of His Royal Highness Prince Friso. It was a great support for them during this difficult time.\"A prognosis on his health situation was expected within a few days, but this was pushed back to 24 February, a week after his accident. The RVD's comment remained the same: stable, but critical. On 24 February, an Innsbruck medical team announced that the prince had been buried for 25 minutes, followed by a 50-minute CPR to treat his cardiac arrest. Wolfgang Koller stated that an MRI scan was performed a day earlier revealing little change, however other neurological tests indicated significant damage due to oxygen shortage. It remained unclear whether the prince would ever regain full consciousness. Koller said that the Prince's family might now look for a rehabilitation institution. On the same day the Dutch Royal Family issued a statement requesting that the privacy of the Prince's family be respected to enable them to come to terms with his condition.On 1 March 2012, Prince Friso was transferred to the Wellington Hospital, in London where he and his wife had lived for many years.On 19 November 2012, it was announced that the prince had started to show some signs of consciousness but it was still not certain whether he would ever wake up, and if he did, in what state.On 9 July 2013, Prince Friso was moved back to Huis ten Bosch in the Netherlands. It was understood that his coma had then evolved into a minimally conscious state. As he was no longer in need of hospital-level medical care, he stayed with his family for the summer.",
        "Death and funeral": "On 12 August 2013, it was announced that Prince Friso had died in Huis ten Bosch due to complications from the accident. He was buried on 16 August in the Dutch Reformed Cemetery in the hamlet of Lage Vuursche near Drakesteijn Castle, where he had spent his childhood and where Princess Beatrix returned to live in February 2014. The funeral service, at Stulpkerk church, was strictly private. Members of the public and media could not attend, nor did members of other royal families attend, with the exception of Friso's godfather, King Harald V of Norway.

    "Steven Fulop": {
        "Introduction": "Steven Michael Fulop (born February 28, 1977) is an American politician serving as the 49th and current mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey. A Democrat, he was formerly the Councilman for Jersey City's Ward E. On May 14, 2013, Fulop defeated incumbent mayor Jerramiah Healy.Fulop assumed the office of mayor on July 1, 2013. He was widely considered likely to run for governor in 2017, but ended this speculation by announcing his intention to run for re-election as mayor. In November 2017, Mayor Fulop was re-elected as mayor of Jersey City with 78% of the vote which represented the largest margin of re-election by a Jersey City mayor since 1949. He was again re-elected in 2021, becoming the first Jersey City mayor to win a third term since Frank Hague. On January 3, 2023, Fulop announced that he will not seek reelection in 2025.",
        "Early life": "Fulop was born in Edison, New Jersey, to Jewish parents, Carmen and Arthur Fulop.  His parents were both born in Romania. His father grew up in Israel and was a sniper in the Golani Brigade during the Six-Day War. He owned a delicatessen in Newark, New Jersey, where Fulop often worked, and his mother Carmen, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, worked in an immigration services office helping others gain citizenship. Through the sixth grade, Fulop attended Rabbi Pesach Raymon Yeshiva, an Orthodox Jewish elementary school in Highland Park, New Jersey, though he himself was not observant. For his last two years of elementary school and his first two years of high school, Fulop attended Solomon Schechter Day School of Essex and Union (now Golda Och Academy) in West Orange, New Jersey.Fulop graduated from J. P. Stevens High School. He went to Harpur College at Binghamton University where he graduated in 1999. During university, he spent time abroad studying at Oxford University in England. In 2006 he completed both his Master of Business Administration at the New York University Stern School of Business and his Master of Public Administration at Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs.",
        "Career": "No information",
        "Finance and military service": "Upon graduating from college, Fulop joined Goldman Sachs, the investment banking firm, first working in Chicago and later in downtown Manhattan and Jersey City. After seeing first hand the effects of the September 11 attacks, he decided to put his career at Goldman Sachs on hold and join the United States Marine Corps.Shortly after completion of Marine Corps boot camp, on January 14, 2003, his reserve unit was activated, and Fulop was deployed to Iraq, where he served as part of the 6th Engineer Support Battalion for six months. He traveled into Baghdad in the early weeks of the war. The battalion focused on engineering, logistics, water purification, and fuel, part of the support infrastructure that allowed swift movement through Iraq.  His unit was written about in numerous periodicals during the war, which highlighted the company's movements, their contributions to the war, and the challenges that they encountered. The New Jersey Star Ledger highlighted Fulop on several occasions as a result of his choice to leave his financial services job to serve his country.\nAfter his service in Iraq, Fulop returned to Goldman Sachs. In early 2006, he left Goldman Sachs to take a position at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., and also completed his service to the Marine Corps Reserve with a rank of Corporal.",
        "Politics": "Then-Governor Chris Christie's muscling of New Jersey's leaders to support his political campaign was exposed by Fulop. Christie's subsequent retaliation against Fulop led to actions that became known as Bridgegate.",
        "Campaign for Congress": "Fulop ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2004 against current U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, who then represented New Jersey's 13th Congressional District; Fulop lost the June 8, 2004 primary election by 74.8 percentage points, 87.4%\u201312.6%.",
        "City Council election": "In May 2005, Fulop was the winner against an incumbent councilman in Jersey City's Ward E, representing the downtown area. When Fulop was sworn into office at 28 years old, he was the youngest member of the city council by more than 17 years and the third youngest in the nearly 200-year existence of the city. However, as noted by The New York Times, the most significant difference between Fulop and every elected official in Jersey City, and most in Hudson County, is that he won the election with no establishment support, beating an incumbent with the backing of Senator Robert Menendez, Mayor Jerramiah Healy of Jersey City, and the Hudson County Democratic organization.Fulop was outspent by more than 2-to-1 during the campaign but several tactical innovations that were highlighted in The Star-Ledger, The New York Times, and The Jersey Journal contributed to Fulop's win against stiff opposition.In May 2009, Fulop was re-elected for a second term with 63% of the vote.  In 2012, the Hudson Reporter named him #4 in its list of Hudson County's 50 most influential people.",
        "Legislation": "As a councilman, one of Fulop's main interests was ethics reform. In September 2007, he proposed legislation that would have restricted use of city vehicles and property, banned officials from holding multiple elected or appointed positions in government, instituted business and income transparency requirements for elected officials and barred people from lobbying an entity in which they serve. This legislation was rejected by a 6\u20131\u20131 vote. Fulop then proposed that Jersey City voters have the opportunity to institute new ethics reform measures by voting on two referendums. The first referendum would prevent elected officials or government employees from collecting more than one taxpayer-financed salary, a practice known as double dipping. By state law, one cannot stop an individual from serving multiple government positions by popular vote, but since state law allows a municipality to hold back a paycheck and benefits if voted on by referendum, it is possible to change the pay structures at the local level to ensure that there is less incentive to collect multiple paychecks and pensions. The second referendum would make it illegal for any entity that does business with the city, such as a developer or contractor, to make a political contribution to a local candidate for a one-year period. This would prohibit those with a specific interest in controlling a singular aspect of local government from bankrolling a local elected official who may have the power to influence that specific interest.",
        "Political prospects": "After his election to a second council term, Fulop was expected by some to run for mayor in 2013. In 2010 a Fulop-backed slate won all three open seats on the Board of Education. In September 2016 Fulop endorsed former rival Phil Murphy for governor, opting to run for his second mayoral term.",
        "Mayor": "On May 14, 2013, Fulop beat sitting mayor Jerramiah T. Healy by 15 percentage points, 53%\u201338%, to become the 49th mayor of Jersey City. Fulop took office on July 1, 2013, with a vision to make Jersey City the \"best mid-sized city in the country\". Due to a healthy population growth rate combined with a significant increase in residential construction, Fulop has asserted that Jersey City will overtake Newark, New Jersey, to become the largest city in New Jersey, possibly as early as late 2016.With a reputation as a reformer during his tenure as councilman, he ran for mayor on a platform that promised to transform local government, make the city safer for residents, expand programs and services, and stabilize taxes. He also set out to make Jersey City the destination of choice, in lieu of the suburbs, for the young urbanites and new families moving from Manhattan.Within his first 100 days in office, Fulop introduced and passed legislation that merged the Police and Fire Departments as well as the Office of Emergency Management into one central department \u2013 the Department of Public Safety. This consolidation is projected to create significant savings for Jersey City by eliminating duplicative administrative costs. Fulop's newly created department was also charged with increasing diversity in both the police and fire department by revising its recruitment and retention efforts, emphasizing that members on the force should be representative of the city they serve.  Fulop also increased the size of the police force from 778 uniformed officers upon assuming office to a projected 840 by June 2014.In an effort to provide transparent and accessible government for the residents of Jersey City, Fulop established (through Executive Order) Jersey City's first Citizen Public Safety Advisory Review Board. This board is charged with making programmatic, legislative, and training recommendations to improve public safety overall. Acknowledging the need for local government to be more responsive to constituents' needs, Fulop overhauled the division of government responsible for handling requests made by citizens, formerly called the \"Mayor's Action Bureau\", into the \"Residents Response Center\", adding more representatives and expanding the hours. Fulop's administration expanded the use of technology and social media for easier access and connectivity to constituent services.Fulop initiated plans to invest nearly $6 million in city parks in 2014 alone, which tripled the annual number of parks projects by renovating 13 parks throughout Jersey City and provided funding for the accelerated construction of Berry Lane Park, an ambitious project that will ultimately transform more than 17 acres of property in to a recreational amenity in the heart of the Bergen-Lafayette community.Fulop's campaign platform included plans for revitalizing the inner city and creating an environment that would also benefit long-term residents by incentivizing development away from the waterfront and into the heart of the inner city. These campaign platform promises materialized into a Tiered tax abatement policy, the first of its kind in Jersey City, which created a mechanism for future development in parts of Jersey City historically ignored by major developers and development projects.In an effort to revitalize the Journal Square business district of Jersey City, in February 2014 Fulop released a request for proposals for the restoration, renovation, and professional management of the historic Loew's Jersey Theatre.In 2011, Jersey City was ranked by Atlantic Magazine as the 10th most artistic city in America, and NerdWallet.com ranked Jersey City the second most diverse city in the United States. Jersey City hosted both Super Bowl XLVIII teams. Fulop launched a branding campaign with the goal of making Jersey City a premier destination for work and play.The Fulop administration's first municipal budget, presented and introduced in March 2014, reduced property taxes by 2.1 percent and provided the City Council flexibility to reduce taxes even further \u2013 up to 5.6 percent. This budget not only reflected the largest total investment in the Department of Recreation for Jersey City within the last five years and the largest percent increase in funding since 1999, but allocated the largest investment in parks in decades. He launched a Jersey City Mural Arts Program, which has facilitated the painting of dozens of murals throughout Jersey City that reflect the diverse communities found within the city. Fulop launched a new prisoner re-entry program within the expanded Jersey City Employment and Training Program (JCETP) under the leadership of former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey. The Jersey City Employment and Training Program has received State and Federal funding and is the strongest program of its kind in New Jersey.In September 2013 (within three months of assuming office), Fulop signed a bill requiring paid sick leave for employees in Jersey City. This legislation makes Jersey City the first city in New Jersey and the sixth city nationally to pass this type of legislation. Fulop aggressively advocated for this policy and worked with the municipal council for its passage citing it as a basic human dignity issue that builds upon the principle that a healthy employee is a more productive employee. The legislation garnered national attention and cemented his reputation as a progressive leader and supporter of working families.In September 2015, Jersey City launched Citi Bike, a bike-sharing program. Citi Bike was specifically chosen for Jersey City because it was already used in New York City, and the systems are connected.Jersey City recently launched United Rescue, an emergency medical first-responder program that leverages citizen volunteers and GPS mobile app-based technology to reduce emergency response times for ambulatory calls, and is expected to make Jersey City EMS response time the fastest in the country. In October 2015 Jersey City officially legalized Airbnb, even while cities like New York resist the homesharing service. Fulop has also been a proponent of using data to make government more transparent and accountable, launching a data portal in October 2015 making available a wide range of information about Jersey City and utilizing data mapping and visualization tools to make the information meaningful.Fulop has been a strong supporter of LGBT rights, officiating at a historic midnight wedding ceremony the night it was officially legalized in New Jersey. Jersey City, which has one of the largest LGBT populations in the state, has received a perfect score of 100 from the Human Rights Campaign's Municipal Equality Index during every year of Fulop's administration, up from 83 in 2012 and better than anywhere else in New Jersey. In September 2015 Jersey City became the first city in the state to expand healthcare coverage to transgender municipal employees.In February 2016, Fulop signed an executive order making Jersey City the first city in New Jersey to provide a $15 minimum wage for all city employees.In May 2018, Fulop opposed subsidies for a troubled real estate project run by the Kushner family. The family had requested a 30-year tax break and approximately $9 million in city-issued bonds from Jersey City.On March 16, 2020, Fulop issued an order requiring that the Jersey City Newport Centre and Hudson Mall shopping centers be closed for an indeterminate period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next day, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, backed this temporary closure and ordered all malls in New Jersey to temporarily close as well.On January 3, 2023, Fulop announced that he will not seek reelection for a fourth term in 2025.",

        "Controversies": "No information",
        "Katy\u0144 Memorial": "In May 2018, Fulop planned to remove the Katy\u0144 Massacre Memorial monument located at Exchange Place in Jersey City, New Jersey. Speaker of the Polish Senate Stanis\u0142aw Karczewski criticized the plan to remove the monument, calling it \"scandalous\". Fulop publicly attacked Karczewski on Twitter, saying:\n\nHere is truth to power outside of a monument. All I can say is this guy is a joke. The fact is that a known anti-Semite, white nationalist + holocaust denier like him has zero credibility. The only unpleasant thing is Senator Stanislaw. Period. I've always wanted to tell him that. \nIn early May 2018, Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg co-signed a letter asking Fulop not to remove the Katy\u0144 Memorial from Exchange Place in the city, writing: \"The memory of the Katyn massacre is an important part of the memory and memories of the Holocaust and we encourage you to reconsider your decision to remove this monument.\"The plans to remove the monument were criticized by Polish officials and Jewish community leaders in Poland. Polish media claimed that the removal plans were revenge for the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance that criminalized blaming Poland for Holocaust atrocities. Fulop subsequently reached an agreement with Poland's consul general to move the statue to a location approximately 200 feet (60 m) away.The issue was resolved on December 20, 2018, when the nine-member Jersey City Council voted unanimously to adopt an ordinance that the monument remain where it stands in Exchange Place \"in perpetuity\".",
        "Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance": "In October 2020, Fulop backed an Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance (or IZO) in Jersey City, New Jersey. Councilmember-at-Large Rolando Lavarro offered critiqued the initial ordinance, mentioning that the ordinance \"has too much flexibility and too many avenues out.\" The Councilmember then attempted to make amendments to the IZO, to no result the council voted against such amendments (2-4-2, Aye Lavarro, Solomon. Nay Robinson, Saleh, Rivera, Watterman. Abstain Ridley, Prinz-Arey, Boggiano).\nAt the public meeting to vote on the IZO, 4 hours of public comments spoke against the measure except for one resident. \"The ordinance as proposed would be one of the weakest, if not the weakest housing ordinances in New Jersey.\" said Fair Share Housing Center attorney Bassam Gergi. Despite this, the measure passed 7-2 (Aye Ridley, Saleh, Prinz-Arey, Rivera, Boggiano, Robinson, Watterman. Nay Lavarro, Solomon).In December 2020, Fair Share Housing Center sued Jersey City, New Jersey to overturn the IZO.In August 2021, Hudson County, New Jersey Presiding Judge Joseph A. Turula ruled that Jersey City, New Jersey officials had violated New Jersey's Municipal Land Use Law when they rushed to adopt it without first referring it to the city's Planning Board for review, therefore the IZO would be thrown out.",
        "Waste Collection Tax": "In January 2021, the Jersey City Municipal Utilities Authority enacted a fee of $1.92 per 100 cubic feet of water to go towards the city's $15.1 million garbage and recycling contract with Elizabeth-based Regional Industries, Inc. The fee, while covering solid waste pickup, was to be calculated based on each home and businesses' water usage, with the goal of including tax-abated properties in those to receive bills. The bill was approved in September 2020, the same year Fulop touted no tax increases.The tax, often touted as a \"backdoor tax\" by many, was opposed by many residents and businesses, amassing above 1000 signatures. With elections coming up in November 2021, Fulop announced that the city was suspending the fee \"until the entire formula is reevaluated.\" In a press release, he also said \"Residents have explained to us that they are being way overcharged on what was supposed to be a nominal fee for their waste collection after these services were acquired by the (Municipal Utilities Authority).\"",
        "Personal life": "Fulop also owns a second house in Narragansett, Rhode Island, where he claims that he and his family have been \"longtime residents\".

Cain Jr. issued a preliminary injunction in Louisiana v. Biden (2022) in favor of the plaintiffs to block federal agency requirements to assess the societal costs of greenhouse gas emissions in regulatory actions under Executive Order 13990. On March 16, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the decision following an appeal by the U.S. Justice Department, and on May 26, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order without comment or opposition dismissing an appeal filed by the plaintiffs to reverse the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision. On February 15, ConocoPhillips announced a pilot program to sell its flare gas to a company operating a bitcoin mine in the Bakken Formation region of North Dakota as part of an industry initiative to reduce routine flaring to zero by 2030. On March 21, the SEC approved rules requiring the disclosure of stock corporation climate risks and net contribution to greenhouse gas emissions in 10-K forms. On the same day, The Wall Street Journal criticized Gensler for proposing legislation requiring public companies to disclose climate risks. \"The proposal ... is contrary to SEC history, securities law, and sound regulatory practice\", the paper wrote. It accused the SEC chairman of trying \"to regulate private companies by the back door\" and following the bidding of BlackRock and other investors.On March 26, CNBC reported that ExxonMobil started a pilot program in January 2021 with Crusoe Energy Systems to also divert its flare gas into generators producing electricity to power shipping containers full of bitcoin miners in the North Dakota Bakken region (which it expanded the following July) as part of the same industry initiative with ConocoPhillips, and that Crusoe has stated reduces carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 63 percent as compared with continued flaring. On April 12, Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms, Shopify, McKinsey & Company, and Stripe, Inc. announced a $925 million advance market commitment of permanent carbon removal from companies that are developing the technology over the next 9 years. On May 19, after Tesla was removed from the S&P 500 ESG Index by S&P Dow Jones Indices, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted a tweet to his Twitter account criticizing the decision and, in noting that ExxonMobil was rated within the top 10 constituent companies in the index by weight, accused ESG of being a scam.On May 25, the SEC proposed two rules changes to ESG investment fund qualifications to prevent greenwashing marketing practices and to increase disclosure requirements for achieving ESG impacts. On June 10, the SEC was reportedly investigating the ESG investment funds of Goldman Sachs for potential greenwashing. After noting that his company had launched a division to commercialize carbon capture in testimony before the U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee on October 28, 2021, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods discussed in an interview with CNBC journalist David Faber on June 24 that part of ExxonMobil's long-term strategy to remain a profitable company while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and plastic pollution was to invest in carbon capture and storage technology with a network hub in Houston and to remain a plastics producer while making improvements to waste management. On June 30, the Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia v. EPA (2022) that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to devise a broad cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions by power plants that the agency attempted to promulgate under the Clean Power Plan and instead that the authority to do so rests with the U.S. Congress.",
        "Social media": "On March 2, 2021, Rocket Mortgage saw a more than 70 percent spike in its stock price during the GameStop short squeeze due to a surge in trading following discussion of the company on r/wallstreetbets, but the Rocket Mortgage stock price reverted back to its pre-surge level the next day. On September 14, Gensler announced the imminent release of an agency report on the short squeeze in testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. On October 18, the SEC released the report. Also in October 2021, eight whistleblower complaints alleging securities fraud by Facebook, Inc. were filed anonymously with the SEC by Whistleblower Aid on behalf of former company employee Frances Haugen after Haugen leaked thousands of company documents to The Wall Street Journal the previous month. After publicly revealing her identity on 60 Minutes, Haugen testified before the U.S. Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security about the content of the leaked documents and the complaints. After the company renamed itself as Meta Platforms, Whistleblower Aid filed two additional securities fraud complaints with the SEC against the company on behalf of Haugen in February 2022.On November 18, 2021, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D\u2013MA) sent a letter to Gensler requesting that the SEC investigate possible securities law violations in the conduct of a merger between the Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC), a special-purpose acquisition company, and the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) announced on October 20. On December 6, an ongoing SEC investigation into the DWAC\u2013TMTG merger was disclosed by DWAC in a filing with the agency. On February 18, 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media. In a securities filing dated June 8 and disclosed to the Florida State Department Corporations Division, DWAC stated that Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. had been removed from the company board of directors. On June 14, DWAC disclosed that the SEC issued a subpoena for additional company documents and information about the merger. On June 27, DWAC disclosed that the SEC issued an additional subpoena as well as an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. On July 19, Amazon.com Inc. filed a lawsuit against more than 10,000 Facebook Group administrators for distributing fake user reviews of Amazon products in violation of Facebook company policies.",
        "Tesla and Twitter": "On November 6, 2021, Tesla, Inc. CEO Elon Musk posted a tweet on his Twitter account that conducted a poll of his followers over whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock. On December 3, Musk had sold approximately $10 billion worth of his Tesla shares. On December 6, the SEC opened an investigation of Tesla in response to a whistleblower complaint alleging the company did not properly disclose to its shareholders fire risks associated with its solar panels. On February 7, 2022, Tesla disclosed in a filing to the SEC that the agency had issued a subpoena to the company for information about company governance policies to comply with an October 2018 settlement with the agency in a securities fraud lawsuit over a tweet Musk posted on his Twitter account about taking Tesla private in August 2018 that the agency subsequently requested that Musk be held in contempt of court for violating in February 2019 (that resulted in an amended settlement the following April), and that the agency sent letters to the company in 2019 and in 2020 warning the company that tweets Musk posted in July 2019 and in May 2020 were in violation of.On February 17, Musk's attorneys filed a letter with the presiding judge in the 2018 settlement alleging that the SEC was attempting to chill his First Amendment right to freedom of speech and that the SEC had failed to pay Tesla shareholders the $40 million in fines the agency had assessed from him and the company under the terms of the settlement, which the SEC disputed in a letter filed with the court in response on February 18. On February 21, Musk's attorneys filed a second letter with the court alleging the SEC had illegally leaked information from an investigation into him. On February 24, Southern New York U.S. District Court Judge Alison Nathan issued an order rejecting requests made by Musk in his February 21 letter, while the SEC was in the process of conducting an insider trading investigation of Musk and his brother Kimbal Musk for a $108 million sale of Tesla stock before Elon's November 2021 tweet.On March 8, Musk filed a motion with the court to have the 2018 settlement with the SEC terminated. On March 22, the SEC filed a response to Musk's March 8 filing requesting that Judge Nathan deny Musk's motion, that its subpoenas were lawful, and disclosed that the agency was investigating Musk for his November 2021 tweet. On March 29, Musk filed another letter with the court reiterating his First Amendment concerns. On April 4, Musk submitted a 13G filing with the SEC to purchase a 9.2% passive ownership stake in Twitter, Inc., but then submitted a Schedule 13D beneficial ownership filing reserving the right to purchase a larger stake in the company with the agency the next day (and because the disclosure was filed later than an SEC deadline, it may have made Musk an additional $156 million). On April 13, a group of Twitter shareholders filed a lawsuit against Musk for failing to disclose his ownership stake to the SEC within the agency's prescribed deadline. On April 14, Musk filed an offer to buy Twitter, Inc. with the SEC for $43 billion and take the company private (which was revised a week later to $46.5 billion).On April 15, Northern California U.S. District Court Judge Edward M. Chen ruled in a lawsuit filed by Tesla shareholders against Musk and the company that his August 2018 tweet was a knowingly made false statement of fact (the day after Musk stated at the 2022 TED conference that it was not). On April 22, Republican Conference members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee wrote a letter to the Twitter board of directors requesting that company executives preserve all company records related to Musk's acquisition proposal. On April 25, the Twitter board of directors unanimously agreed to Musk's acquisition proposal at $44 billion. On April 27, Southern New York U.S. District Court Judge Lewis J. Liman denied Musk's motion to terminate the 2018 settlement. On April 30, Musk filed an amicus brief along with Dallas Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban in support of a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court by a former chief financial officer at Xerox to review a 2003 settlement the Xerox CFO made with the SEC that includes a gag order that the plaintiff argues is in violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.On May 13, Musk posted a tweet that his acquisition of Twitter would be put on hold until statistics about spambots and fake accounts on Twitter were verified, while the SEC and the Federal Trade Commission began investigations of Musk for violating filing deadlines for his Twitter passive ownership stake and his subsequent company acquisition proposal respectively. On May 16, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal posted a tweet detailing company policies for addressing fake and spam accounts in response to Musk (to which Musk posted a tweet in return). On May 17, Musk tweeted that the Twitter acquisition would not move forward until he had greater clarification about the ratio of fake and spam accounts on the site, later tweeting a poll of his followers' opinions of Twitter, Inc. statements about the ratio of fake and spam accounts in filings to the SEC (and where Musk posted a comment in the poll thread calling upon the SEC to investigate whether the company's statements disclosing the ratio in filings to the agency are true).On the same day, Twitter submitted a new filing with the SEC that stated that Musk had met with Twitter executives for three days before he announced his acquisition proposal. On May 24, Reuters reported that since the April 2019 amended settlement between Musk and the SEC, agency officials have consciously chosen not to pursue legal action against Musk for violating the terms of the agreement and to write letters urging compliance instead due to remarks made by the presiding judge during the case. On May 25, Twitter shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk and Twitter, Inc. alleging market manipulation and violation of California corporate laws. On June 3, a dozen political advocacy groups (including the Center for Countering Digital Hate, GLAAD, and MediaJustice) announced a campaign to block Musk's Twitter acquisition proposal by pressuring government agencies to review the acquisition, persuading Tesla shareholders to take legal action against the proposal, and asking advertisers to boycott the platform.On June 6, Musk's attorneys disclosed a letter to the SEC accusing Twitter executives of a material breach of contract due to lack of information provided about fake and spam accounts and claimed to reserve Musk's right to terminate the merger agreement (despite Musk waiving due diligence in his offer to buy the company on April 14). On July 1, an investment management group affiliated with the pension funds of Strategic Organizing Center labor unions wrote a letter to the SEC requesting that the agency investigate Tesla for violating the terms of the October 2018 settlement with the agency after the company disclosed in its annual proxy statement (filed with the SEC the previous month) that Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison did not intend to stand for re-election as company chairman and that the company did not intend to replace his seat on the board (thereby reducing its size).On July 8, Musk filed a letter with the SEC sent to Twitter executives notifying them that he intended to terminate his acquisition proposal of the company, to which Twitter Board Chairman Bret Taylor posted a tweet stating that the company would continue to attempt to close the transaction and that it would pursue legal action to enforce the merger. On July 12, Twitter Inc. filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery to enforce the acquisition agreement. On July 14, the SEC disclosed a letter sent to Musk on June 2 for additional information about his 13D filing on April 5. On July 15, Musk filed a motion requesting that the court not grant Twitter's request for a speedy trial, while Twitter submitted an amended proxy statement with the SEC that urged company shareholders to approve the acquisition agreement.On July 18, Twitter submitted a filing with the court stating that Musk's request to deny a speedy trial was a tactical delay, that Musk's tactics were harming Twitter's reputation and share price, and urged the court to schedule the earliest possible trial date. On July 19, the court ruled in Twitter's favor and scheduled a five-day trial to take place the following October. On July 22, Twitter released its earnings report for the second quarter of 2022 that showed a 1 percent decline in year-over-year company revenue and that company earnings were lower than analysts' expectations (which the company partially attributed to uncertainty created by the acquisition agreement). On July 25, Tesla disclosed in a filing with the SEC that the company had received a second subpoena from the agency on June 13 with respect to the 2018 settlement. On July 26, Twitter disclosed in filing with the SEC that the company had scheduled a shareholder meeting on September 13, 2022, to vote on the acquisition agreement.In a complaint filed by Whistleblower Aid with the SEC, the U.S. Justice Department, and the Federal Trade Commission on July 6, former Twitter security officer Peiter Zatko alleged that specific Twitter executives\u2014including Parag Agrawal and certain board members\u2014have repeatedly made false and misleading statements to its board, shareholders, users, regulators, and the public about privacy, security, and content moderation on the platform since 2011 in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and SEC disclosure rules including misrepresentations to Musk during the course of the acquisition bid (citing Agrawal's May 16 tweet detailing company policies for addressing fake and spam accounts).",

    "Dick Gephardt": {
        "Introduction": "Richard Andrew Gephardt (; born January 31, 1941) is an American attorney, lobbyist, and politician who served as a United States Representative from Missouri from 1977 to 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, he was House Majority Leader from 1989 to 1995 and Minority Leader from 1995 to 2003. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 1988 and 2004. Gephardt was mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1988, 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2008.Since his retirement from politics, Gephardt has become a significant lobbyist.  He founded a Washington-based public affairs firm, Gephardt Government Affairs, an Atlanta-based labor consultancy, the Gephardt Group, as well as a direct primary care group, SolidaritUS Health. He also consults for DLA Piper, FTI Consulting and Goldman Sachs and is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One and co-chair of Issue One's Council for Responsible Social Media with former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey.",
        "Early life": "Gephardt was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Loreen Estelle (n\u00e9e Cassell) and Louis Andrew Gephardt, a Teamster milkman; part of his ancestry is German. He graduated from the former Southwest High School in 1958. Gephardt is an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. He earned his B.S. at Northwestern University in 1962 where he was president of Beta Theta Pi, the student senate, and his freshman class. He earned his J.D. at the University of Michigan Law School in 1965.\nIn 1965, he was admitted to the Missouri Bar. He then entered the Missouri Air National Guard, where he served until 1971.\nHe and his wife Jane have three grown children, Matt, Katie, and Chrissy. His brother, Donald L. Gephardt, was the Dean of The College of Fine and Performing Arts at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey.",
        "Political career": "Gephardt was Democratic committeeman for the 14th ward in St. Louis from 1968 to 1971, moving up to become 14th ward alderman from 1971 to 1976, as part of a group of young aldermen known informally as \"The Young Turks.\"",
        "House of Representatives": "In 1976, Gephardt was elected to Congress from the St. Louis\u2013based 3rd District, succeeding 24-year incumbent Leonor Sullivan. He was elected 13 more times, opting not to run for reelection in 2004. For most of his Congressional career, Gephardt's National Political Director was St. Louis\u2013based political consultant Joyce Aboussie. Gephardt voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday in August 1983 but did not vote on the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (or the vote to override President Reagan's veto in March 1988).",
        "1988 presidential campaign": "Gephardt was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 1988 presidential election. Gephardt formally announced his candidacy in February 1987\u2014one of the first to do so\u2014and campaigned hard in Iowa, ultimately spending over 100 days in the state. He was stuck in low double digits in polls, but began moving ahead in Iowa in late December 1987 after running an ad that criticized trade barriers by Korea and Japan as unfair- known as the \"Hyundai Ad.\" Gephardt won the Iowa caucuses and South Dakota primary in February while finishing a strong second in New Hampshire, making him a serious contender for the nomination.Gephardt's early victories did not translate into support in other states, though, and he was not able to raise adequate funds to compete in the Southern primaries. His campaign ran out of money after losing badly in the March \"Super Tuesday\" primaries, when he won only the Missouri primary. An ad aired by Governor Michael Dukakis's campaign focused on Gephardt's \"flip-flopping\" voting record and showed a Gephardt look-alike doing forward and backward flips for the camera. Many felt the ad killed any chance Gephardt had of winning the nomination. Gephardt dropped out after winning only 13% in Michigan, despite support from the United Auto Workers. Dukakis considered selecting Gephardt as his vice presidential running mate but instead chose Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen.",
        "House leadership": "In part due to the visibility gained from his 1988 presidential bid, Gephardt was elected majority leader by his House colleagues in June 1989, making him the second-ranking Democrat in the House, behind then-Speaker Tom Foley. Gephardt served in that position until January 1995.\nAfter Foley was unseated in the Republican landslide of 1994 that gave the Republicans a 52-seat majority, Gephardt became the leader of the House Democrats, as minority leader, initially opposite Newt Gingrich and then, from 1999 onward, Dennis Hastert. When Gingrich faced a coup within his own party in 1997, Gephardt could have become Speaker if there had been a floor vote and he gained the support of Republican members dissatisfied with Gingrich, but Gingrich refused to resign and no vote occurred. In the 1996, 1998, and 2000 elections, Gephardt led the Democrats to gains in the House, although they did not retake the majority until 2006, after Gephardt had left Congress.\nGephardt became a prolific financial supporter of Democrats around the country in the early 1990s, assembling a team of top fundraising staff who helped him support hundreds of candidates for local and federal office. Although Gephardt worked hard for many of President Bill Clinton's programs, he and his union supporters strongly opposed NAFTA and other \"free trade\" programs, so Clinton relied on Republican support to pass those initiatives. During the impeachment proceedings of President Clinton, Gephardt led a walkout in the House after a censure motion was ruled irrelevant to the impeachment debate.\n\nIn 2000, Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore named Gephardt to his short list of possible vice presidential candidates. The other names on the short list were Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, North Carolina Senator John Edwards, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, and New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen. Gore eventually selected Lieberman.\nIn the 2002 Congressional midterm elections, Gephardt campaigned on the economy and Social Security, but the continuing resonance of the September 11 attacks, the momentum for military action against Iraq, and President George W. Bush's popularity lead to Republican gains, with the Democrats losing four House seats. Harold Ford Jr. of Tennessee called the results an \"absolute blowout\" and called upon Gephardt to step down, saying that it was time for \"new ideas and new faces\". Due to his previous success, it has been said that Gephardt would have been easily returned as Minority Leader if he had decided to stay on. However, Gephardt, who was planning to run for president in 2004, did not run for reelection as House Minority Leader, stepping down in January 2003. His leadership position was contested by the centrist Martin Frost, the outgoing Democratic Caucus Chair, and the liberal Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Whip, who was elected as Gephardt's successor. No longer having Congressional leadership duties freed Gephardt up to concentrate on a 2004 presidential bid.",
        "2004 campaign for president": "Gephardt announced his second run for president on January 5, 2003. His successor as Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, endorsed him. His campaign was notable for the high-profile coming out of his daughter Chrissy in People magazine, while she was helping him on the campaign trail, a subject they also discussed in interviews for the 2007 documentary film For the Bible Tells Me So; he has continued to be an outspoken advocate for gay rights since the campaign.Although Republicans considered him a formidable candidate, Gephardt was seen by many as too old-fashioned and unelectable. His fundraising efforts were behind those of former Vermont Governor Howard Dean and Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, and tied with Joe Lieberman. Gephardt's support of the Iraq War resolution hurt him among liberal activists. He promoted a form of universal health care, and was backed by 21 labor unions, but did not have enough support to receive the AFL\u2013CIO's endorsement.\n\nThroughout early 2003, Gephardt was ahead in polling for the Iowa caucus, but by August Dean had taken the lead, his campaign fueled by antiwar activists. The Gephardt campaign was embarrassed by an early August St Louis Post-Dispatch article that revealed that 11 of the 33 \"Gephardt team leaders\" listed on his Iowa campaign's website actually supported other candidates or were neutral.\nThe race between Gephardt and Dean became negative, and took an ugly turn in October when a Gephardt staffer reportedly pushed a Dean staffer out of a meeting while calling him a \"faggot\". Many press at the event claimed the Dean staffer was picking a fight and that the Gephardt staffer did not make the hurtful comment. Dean chairman Joe Trippi (who worked for Gephardt in 1988) and Gephardt chairman Steve Murphy became involved in a war of words over the incident, as well as Murphy's allegation that the Dean campaign was bringing in out-of-state non-residents to participate in the caucus. In the final days of the Iowa campaign, both Dean and Gephardt faded, and they finished third and fourth, respectively. Gephardt ended his presidential campaign after that disappointing result.After he dropped out of the presidential race, Gephardt was mentioned as a possible running mate for John Kerry. On March 7, 2004, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, also seen as a strong contender for the position, endorsed Gephardt for Vice President. \"I think he's the best candidate,\" Richardson said of Gephardt in an interview with the Associated Press. \"There's a good regional balance with Kerry and Gephardt.\" Kerry announced on July 6, 2004, that he had chosen John Edwards as his running mate. On the same day, the New York Post published a headline stating that Gephardt had become Kerry's running mate. The headline was compared to the 1948 \"Dewey defeats Truman\" headline in the Chicago Tribune that incorrectly reported the presidential election results that year. In 2007, it was revealed in Kerry campaign adviser Bob Shrum's book No Excuses: Concessions of a Serial Campaigner that Kerry wanted to choose Gephardt but was convinced by Shrum and others to choose Edwards.",
        "Political views": "After his election to the U.S. House in 1976, Gephardt's political views gradually moved to the left. Originally, Gephardt was strongly anti-abortion and was viewed as a social conservative. He was initially extremely critical of the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. He wrote on the subject in 1984:\n\nLife is the division of human cells, a process that begins with conception. The (Supreme Court's abortion) ruling was unjust, and it is incumbent on the Congress to correct the injustice... I have always been supportive of pro-life legislation. I intend to remain steadfast on this issue.... I believe that the life of the unborn should be protected at all costs.\nIn 1987, when Gephardt decided to run for president, he announced that he would no longer support legislation to restrict abortion rights. He told the National Right to Life Committee; \"I now do not support any Constitutional amendment pertaining to the legality of abortion.\"\nGephardt's views on economic policy also changed over the years. He voted for Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in 1981; in the 2000s, however, he became a staunch opponent of similar tax cuts by President George W. Bush, saying that the enormous surplus created during the administration of Bill Clinton should have been spent on health care instead. Gephardt is widely viewed as an economic populist. He supports universal health coverage, fair trade, and progressive taxation. Although he once chaired the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, Gephardt in his later years in Congress distanced himself from the organization, finding his pro-labor views at odds with the DLC's pro-business positions.\nOn October 10, 2002, Gephardt was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the invasion of Iraq. He was an early supporter of the war, and cosponsor of the authorization resolution. However, three years later Gephardt said of his support for the war that \"It was a mistake ... I was wrong.\"",
        "Post-congressional career": "On January 3, 2005, Gephardt's three-decade political career ended with the expiration of his 14th term in the House of Representatives. That month, Gephardt started a consulting and lobbying firm, Gephardt Group, of which he is president and CEO. Gephardt also joined the international law firm DLA Piper as strategic advisor in the government affairs practice group from June 2005 to December 2009.In his new role as a Washington lobbyist, Gephardt, on behalf of the Republic of Turkey, has been actively lobbying against the House resolution condemning the Armenian genocide of 1915 in the Ottoman Empire. While supportive of the resolution while in Congress, he now contends that facts need to be better known before any position is taken on this historical controversy.Gephardt served on the board of directors of the Embarq Corporation from June 2007 to July 1, 2009, when he became a member of the board of directors of CenturyLink, Embarq's successor corporation. Gephardt also serves as a director of Centene Corporation, Ford Motor Company, Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc., and United States Steel Corporation. He joined Ford's board in 2009.In July 2007, Gephardt endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, leading some to speculate that he was interested in running for vice president in 2008. DLA Piper become a major donor to Clinton's campaign, donating about $190,000. Gephardt was mentioned during the summer of 2008 as a possible vice-presidential choice for eventual nominee Senator Barack Obama.\nA collection of Gephardt's congressional documents, dating from 1994 to 2004, was processed from 2006 to 2007 by the Missouri Historical Society for academic use, with a grant through the Institute of Museum and Library Services. In 2005, Washington University in St. Louis inaugurated the Richard A. Gephardt Institute of Public Service (now the Gephardt Institute for Civic and Community Engagement), which educates students for life-long engaged citizenship and civic leadership. Since 2005, Gephardt has been a consultant to Goldman Sachs and DLA Piper. Since 2007 he has been a consultant to FTI Consulting.In 2007, Gephardt began serving on the advisory board of the Extend Health insurance company, and then became a member of its board of directors. In 2009, Gephardt advised UnitedHealth Group, one of America's largest private insurers, in waging a strong campaign against a public option for national health care.In 2010, Gephardt was elected chair of the Board of Trustees of The Scripps Research Institute, a nonprofit institute focusing on biomedical research.Gephardt has also been significantly involved with the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. In addition to a large lobbying contract with the Medicines Company, he serves as chair of the Council for American Medical Innovation (CAMI), formed by and affiliated with PhRMA. In this capacity he hired his own firm to lobby for the organization, to push to extend patents and block generic drugs from the market. In 2016, Gephardt also co-founded a Direct primary care group called SolidaritUS Health, with the goal of increasing the accessibility of quality healthcare to working families.\nGephardt has also served as a lobbyist for Boeing. He is a labor consultant for Spirit Aerosystems and sits on its board of directors. In these roles, Gephardt has presided over an aggressive anti-union campaign that has bewildered many of his traditional political allies. In July 2011, Spirit Aerosystems walked out of negotiations with the union that represents its engineering, technical and professional workforce. The union subsequently voted down the company's last contract offer, with 96.5% voting no. The company did not change its contract offer significantly after this rejection and relations with its workforce have been contentious ever since.

I had played 22 straight years of organized baseball, since I was 7. I had had enough. I would have continued playing if I hadn't hurt my knee. But I was looking forward to doing something else.\"  He added that his career was worth it: \"Absolutely. Everywhere I played I had fun. The most impressive thing being with the White Sox was how congenial everybody was. Carlton Fisk. Harold Baines. Tom Seaver. They were all superstars. Yet they were extremely nice to me and tried to help me as much as they could. No question. It was worth it.\"\nAfter Gilbert was nominated to be a U.S. Ambassador in 2013, his former major league manager, Tony La Russa, told the Associated Press: \"Sure, I remember him. I was always taken with his intelligence and how he was committed to what we were trying to teach \u2014 to become a teammate, a competitor, and to pursue excellence as a professional.

Sununu, for their work to pass the New England Wilderness act, which classified nearly 100,000 acres (400 km2) of New Hampshire and Vermont as wilderness. In 2006, Gregg received a score of 43% from the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters.The University of New Hampshire renamed its Environmental Technology Building Gregg Hall, because Gregg used earmarks to secure $266 million of federal funds for research and development projects for the university. The Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute (JGMI), established in 2003, is the center of meteorological and atmospheric research at Plymouth State University in Plymouth, NH, which offers the only meteorology degree program in the state. The Senator was also instrumental in the establishing of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in 1999.\nIn 2007, Gregg voted for the Clean Energy Act of 2007 (H.R. 6) and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S. 1639).\nIn October 2009, Gregg said, \"You talk about systemic risk. The systemic risk today is the Congress of the United States ... we're creating these massive debts which we're passing on to our children ... (the figures) mean we're basically on the path to a banana republic-type of financial situation in this country. \"\nGregg has a moderate record on social issues. In June 2006, he joined six of his fellow Republicans in voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In April 2007, he was among the breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on the issue of abortion is otherwise a solidly anti-abortion one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.\nOn December 17, 2009, Gregg voted to extend Chairman Ben Bernanke's term.",
        "Presidential politics": "During the 2004 Presidential Election, Gregg stood in for John Kerry during practice sessions held by George W. Bush in preparation for the 2004 United States Presidential Election Debates. Four years earlier he had played the part of Al Gore for the same purpose.\nOn October 29, 2007, Gregg endorsed Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts, to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.\nGregg has not foreclosed the possibility of running for President himself after he leaves the Senate but he has said it's \"not likely\":\n\nIn New Hampshire we like to have a variety of candidates, so I would seriously doubt that. I expect to be actively involved in the presidential primary. That's the fun on coming from New Hampshire and being in office,\" Gregg said.\n\"I don't rule out anything in my future. Let's face it -- that's not likely and I wouldn't expect to be doing that,\" he added.",
        "The Spanish Justice System and Guantanamo Bay": "In April 2009, Senator Gregg was sent to accompany an American diplomat to speak with a Spanish diplomat Luis Felipe Fern\u00e1ndez de la Pe\u00f1a after a war crimes case was filed by Spanish NGO Association for the Dignity of Spanish Prisoners at the Audiencia Nacional of Spain accusing them of crimes in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. The case targeted six former US government officials for allegedly violating the Geneva Convention, the 1984 Convention Against Torture, and the 1998 Rome Statute. The six accused were: Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Douglas Feith, Jay Bybee, and John Yoo. A summary of the meeting as recorded in a confidential diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks stated:\n\nSenator Gregg expressed his concern and dismay about reported Spanish judiciary desire to indict six former Bush administration officials for allegedly creating a legal framework that permitted torture. Fernandez de la Pena lamented this development, adding that judicial independence notwithstanding, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disagreed with efforts to apply universal jurisdiction in such cases.\nSenator Mel Martinez had a similar diplomacy meeting during the same period with the same agenda discussed. Martinez noted that \"the prosecutions would neither be understood nor accepted in the U.S. and would have an enormous impact on the bilateral relationship\". Spanish Foreign Minister Angel Lossada retorted, \"the National Court had broad jurisdiction for universal justice and that there was no political influence on the judicial process.\"In an earlier cable days before the senators arrived, a US diplomat commented:\n\nWe do not know if the [Spanish] government would be willing to take the risky step of trying behind the scenes to influence the prosecutor's recommendation on this case or what their reaction to such a request would be.",
        "Controversies": "In the Senate, Gregg was the leading Republican negotiator and author of the TARP program, which bailed out financial institutions, while he had a multimillion-dollar investment in Bank of America. After leaving the Senate Gregg became an advisor to the investment bank Goldman Sachs.In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire into an industrial park. According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base. Gregg has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House's discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family's real estate investments in Pease. Gregg explained away his actions by saying, \"I've throughout my entire lifetime been involved in my family's businesses and that's just the way our family works. We support each other and our activities.\"Gregg as a member of President Barack Obama's deficit commission defended cutting Social Security by quoting Willie Sutton who, when asked why he robbed banks, replied, \"because that's where the money is.\"",
        "Commerce Secretary nomination and withdrawal": "On February 2, 2009, Politico and CNN reported that Gregg accepted President Obama's offer to be the next United States Secretary of Commerce. If Gregg had been confirmed by the Senate, he would have had to resign his Senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by Democratic Governor John Lynch. Sources from both parties confirmed that Gregg's former chief of staff, Republican Bonnie Newman, would have been chosen to replace him. The Washington Post had alleged that Gregg would not accept the appointment unless Gov. Lynch agreed to appoint a Republican to fill his seat until 2010. In February 2009, many news outlets noted that Gregg had in 1995 voted to abolish the United States Department of Commerce. Although Gregg stated that he supported the stimulus package promoted by President Obama, he clarified that he would recuse himself from voting on the package.With reports that the Obama Administration would move the United States Census Bureau, typically run by the Commerce Department, out of Gregg's jurisdiction, Republican leaders urged Obama to allow Gregg to run the census or withdraw Gregg's nomination. On February 12, 2009, Gregg withdrew his name from consideration for the position of United States Commerce Secretary, citing disagreements with issues surrounding the census and the stimulus bill. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a statement regarding Gregg's withdrawal in which he accused the senator of not following through on his alleged statements of support for Obama's economic agenda made during the vetting process:\nSenator Gregg reached out to the President and offered his name for Secretary of Commerce.  He was very clear throughout the interviewing process that despite past disagreements about policies, he would support, embrace, and move forward with the President's agenda.  Once it became clear after his nomination that Senator Gregg was not going to be supporting some of President Obama's key economic priorities, it became necessary for Senator Gregg and the Obama administration to part ways. We regret that he has had a change of heart.\nWhile speaking to press afterward, Gregg acknowledged responsibility for his decision and accepted the blame for accepting and then rejecting the Commerce Secretary nomination.In an interview response to the AP, Gregg was quoted as saying,\n\nFor 30 years, I've been my own person in charge of my own views, and I guess I hadn't really focused on the job of working for somebody else and carrying their views, and so this is basically where it came out.\nIn February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the Senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base into an industrial park. According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base.

First elected as a Conservative, Gyimah rebelled against the government to block a no-deal Brexit and had the Conservative whip removed in September 2019. He subsequently joined the Liberal Democrats and stood unsuccessfully for them in Kensington at the 2019 general election. Gyimah now serves on the board of Goldman Sachs International.\nBetween 2014 and 2018, after serving as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, David Cameron, and as a government whip, Gyimah was promoted to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. He served as the Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation from January 2018 until he resigned on 30 November 2018 in protest at Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement.",
        "Early life": "Gyimah was born on 10 August 1976 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. His father Samuel was a GP, and his mother Comfort Mainoo was a midwife. When he was six years old, his parents split up and his mother returned to her native Ghana with Gyimah and his younger brother and sister while his father remained in the UK.

        "Parliamentary career": "No information",
        "Conservative MP (2010\u20132019)": "Following his name being added to the Conservatives' A-List, he was selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate for East Surrey and elected at the 2010 general election, making his maiden speech on 29 July 2010. Gyimah became a member of the International Development Select Committee, and stated an interest in harnessing the private sector towards achieving international development goals. He also began to take an active part in debates on education and employment and in some local campaigns to protect the green belt in Surrey.In 2011, Gyimah produced a report with the think-tank NESTA, \"Beyond the Banks: the case for a British Industry and Enterprise Bond\", in support of non-bank alternatives for businesses seeking finance. He was the first member of parliament to call for credit-easing as a means of accelerating Britain's economic recovery.Gyimah was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Prime Minister at the 2012 reshuffle, then became a Government Whip in October 2013, supporting the Prime Minister during the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition. He supported the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union in the EU referendum of 2016.Gyimah was Childcare and Education Minister during the progress of the 2015\u20132016 Childcare Bill, designed to deliver 30 hours per week of funded childcare for working parents of 3 and 4 year olds.  The Childcare Bill also required local authorities to publish information about local childcare availability for parents and caregivers. The bill became law as the Childcare Act on 16 March 2016.On 20 November 2015, Gyimah contributed to the filibustering of the opposition-proposed Compulsory Emergency First Aid Education (State-Funded Secondary Schools) Bill to make the teaching of first aid in secondary schools compulsory. He spoke until the end of the debate, despite requests from the deputy speaker. Gyimah was quoted as being concerned to not overload the National Curriculum.On 4 July 2016, as Childcare and Education Minister, Gyimah launched Millie's Mark, a voluntary quality mark described as \"the new gold standard\" for nursery providers that trained all their staff in pediatric first aid.On 21 October 2016, Gyimah filibustered the Sexual Offences (Pardons) bill (nicknamed the \"Turing Bill\" after Alan Turing), a private member's bill presented by the Scottish National Party MP John Nicolson that sought to pardon all men convicted of abolished offences under the sodomy laws, on the grounds that granting automatic pardons to all men convicted of historic 'gay sex crimes' would mean that some men who had raped and/or had sex with young men under the age of 16 would be pardoned. Supporters of the bill disputed this, as they proposed conditions for a pardon which included the act being consensual and that it would not be contrary to present-day British law. He instead supported an amendment proposed by the government to existing legislation, in which only dead men convicted of such offences were automatically pardoned, while those who were living would have to apply to the Home Office through a \"disregard\" process whereby the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the conduct is no longer criminal. The \"Turing Bill\" became law on 31 January 2017.Other than the aforementioned Turing Law, Gyimah has consistently voted in favour of LGBT equality, including the right of same-sex couples to marry in all of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.As Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation, Gyimah toured university campuses around the country for question-and-answer-sessions with students, staff and the public. He called on Higher Education leaders to prioritize student mental health, and spoke of his own financial struggles as an undergraduate. Gyimah has warned that \"there's a culture of censorship in some of our universities\" and that threats to freedom of speech were not \"some right-wing conspiracy theory that had been made up\". Some of the examples he has mentioned included a professor at King's College London who was allegedly reported for hate speech after teaching a history class, and a university's safe-space policy that took twenty minutes to read. In both cases, the universities in question reported that these things did not happen, and the Department for Education clarified later that Gyimah had merely relayed students' anecdotes.On 30 November 2018, Gyimah became the seventh government minister to resign over Theresa May's Brexit deal, which he called naive, saying: \"Britain will end up worse off, transformed from rule makers into rule takers. It is a democratic deficit and a loss of sovereignty\". He called May's withdrawal agreement \"a deal in name only\" with many unresolved issues that would leave the UK at the mercy of the European Union with no leverage for many years to come.\nHe said the UK's weakness in the negotiations over the Galileo satellite navigation project was the final straw and he intended to vote against May's deal in the House of Commons on 11 December 2018, and suggested the public should have the right to a final say on the withdrawal agreement in another referendum with the Article 50 process extended. Gyimah resigned as a minister because he wants to be free to endorse a second referendum on Brexit. In early 2019, he co-founded the group Right to Vote.On 2 June 2019, Gyimah announced his intention to stand as a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership election. He was the only leadership candidate advocating for a second referendum. He withdrew on 10 June, the day that candidatures were to be formalised.",
        "Conservative whip withdrawal and joining the Liberal Democrats": "On 3 September 2019, Gyimah joined twenty other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson. The rebel MPs voted with the Opposition against a Conservative motion which subsequently failed. Effectively, they helped block Johnson's \"no deal\" Brexit plan from proceeding on 31 October. Subsequently, all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative whip, expelling them as Conservative MPs, requiring them to sit as independents. Before the vote Gyimah had described Johnson's position as: \"For MPs like myself, Downing Street has framed the choice as: speak your mind or keep your job.\" If they decided to run for re-election in a future election, the Party would block their selection as Conservative candidates.On 14 September, he joined the Liberal Democrats and was appointed Shadow Secretary for Business, Energy and Industrial Energy the following month. In December at the 2019 general election, he stood for the Liberal Democrats in Kensington, finishing third with 21% of the vote.",

On July 22, 1998, The Haas Brothers won the Jersey All Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship by defeating The Skin Head Express. They lost it to The Nation of Immigration just over a month later on August 25. They won the championship for the second time on May 21, 1999, by defeating The Big Unit (Rick Silver and Dave Desire), and held the championship until February 25, 2000 when they were defeated by Da Hit Squad.

On July 10, they lost the championship to The Backseat Boyz at Caged To The End, when Johnny Kashmere defeated Russ in a singles match and was awarded the championship.",
        "World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2000\u20132005)": "After a World Wrestling Federation (WWF) tryout match at Madison Square Garden on August 7, 2000, they signed a developmental contract with WWF. The two worked their way through the tag ranks in the WWF's developmental territories, Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW) and the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). The brothers won the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship three times during early 2001, defeating The Dupps the first time and The Island Boyz and Joey Matthews and Christian York in a three-way match on both the second and third occasions. Russ died from a heart attack due to a pre-existing heart condition, on December 15, 2001 at age 27. The brothers fought in house shows and dark matches in the WWF up until Russ died. After Russ' death, Charlie continue to fight in dark matches. After Russ' death as a tribute to him, Haas wrote Russ' name on his wrist tape, and used the name \"R.C. Haas\" (standing for Russ\u2013Charlie) before being called up to the main WWE roster. On January 2, 2002, Haas won the HWA Heavyweight Championship, his first singles championship, by defeating Val Venis. He was later stripped of the title on January 29 due to a scripted contract loophole. After World Wrestling Entertainment (renamed from the WWF) ended its affiliation with the HWA, Haas was moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) where he competed until December 2002.Haas debuted on WWE's main roster on the December 26, 2002 episode of SmackDown! as a heel (villainous character) along with Shelton Benjamin as Team Angle. The tag team was the \"contingency plan\" of Paul Heyman, and were intended to help WWE Champion Kurt Angle retain his title, attacking Chris Benoit and Brock Lesnar in an attempt to soften them up. They quickly won the WWE Tag Team Championship on February 6, 2003, by defeating Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero Jr.). They held the championship for three months, including a successful title defense at WrestleMania XIX against Los Guerreros and the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno, before losing the championship to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri in a ladder match on May 18 at Judgment Day. On the June 12 episode of SmackDown!, Angle fired Haas and Benjamin after they blamed him for losing the Tag Team Championship and began to question his leadership. The duo then dubbed themselves The World's Greatest Tag Team, although announcers made sure to add \"Self Proclaimed\" to the name. Haas and Benjamin regained the championship from Guerrero and Tajiri on the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, but lost it to the reformed Los Guerreros on September 18. The team was separated when Benjamin was moved to the Raw brand as part of the 2004 Draft Lottery.\n\nAfter Benjamin's draft, Haas turned into a fan favorite and gained Miss Jackie as a valet.  He teamed with Rico to win the WWE Tag Team Championship on April 22, 2004. The pair lost the championship to the Dudley Boyz on June 17, and shortly afterwards, Haas became a singles wrestler, although he retained Miss Jackie as his valet.

        "Points of view": "Hormats has been a supporter of legislation that would increase investments in infrastructure in America through a national bank that would develop public-private partnerships for large transportation projects. \"It's a high national priority,\" Hormats told Congressional Quarterly in March 2008. \"Public-private cooperation is a really critical part. The needs are urgent.\" He and others argue that U.S. transportation infrastructure has lagged behind foreign competitors. Unless the country picks up the pace, it will not be able to support its growing trade and population.He is an advocate of enhancing intelligence capabilities, modernizing military equipment and spending more money on preparing first-responders like firemen and emergency medical technicians for crises. He worries that future presidential administrations will spend less than they should on homeland security because to do so will require raising taxes or cutting non-defense programs. He also worries that the unpopularity of the Iraq war will cause the country to reduce its military presence overseas.Hormats has argued that China and America are financially intertwined. It would not be in China\u2019s financial interest, he argued, to destabilize the dollar by recalling the country\u2019s vast loans to the U.S. Doing so would result in a shrunken export market for China. Hormats calls this MAD\u2014mutually assured depression. In 2004, the government fined Goldman Sachs $2 million for illegally and selectively promoting the stock of four Asian companies that were about to go public. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Hormats and others \"made illegal offerings of securities to select customers in 1999 and 2000 and made inappropriate statements to the press.\" Hormats told four media outlets that PetroChina, a Chinese-based oil producer, was not invested in Darfur. The disclosure was illegal under SEC rules, because the company had not yet gone public, and Hormats would not have been allowed to comment until it had done so.",

        "Early life": "Huang received his B.A. in Economics from National Taiwan University in 1977 and Ph.D. in Financial economics from Stanford University in the United States in 1983. He was on the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management from 1983 to 1994, and was a full professor holding the J.C. Penney Professorship in Finance when he left MIT in the summer of 1994.",
        "Career": "Huang co-founded, with Myron Scholes, Platinum Grove Asset Management L.P. (PGAM), an investment management company based in Rye Brook, New York in 1999. He was the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of PGAM from 1999 to 2009, and served as Non-Executive Chairman from 2010 to 2013. See Myron Scholes #Investment activity. PGAM was one of the largest fixed income relative value focused hedge funds in the ten years Huang was its CEO and CIO.\nBefore founding PGAM, Huang was with Long Term Capital Management L.P. from 1995 to 1999 and was a Partner and Co-Head of its Asia office in Tokyo from 1997 to 1999.

ISBN 0135006538.), a textbook for graduate students in financial markets.",
        "Research": "As an academic, his most extensive work has been in dynamic general equilibrium theory. Here he has developed two main themes. The first theme concerns the relations between the revelation of new information to the agents in an economy and the characteristics of asset prices in an economy. His results justified some key assumptions underlying much of the modern work on asset pricing.\nThe second main theme concerns the critical allocational role of securities markets. Previous research suggested that an efficient allocation of resources would require markets for far more securities than actually exist. Huang's work shifted the focus of discussion from the number of markets to the nature of dynamic trading opportunities. He showed that an efficient allocation of resources could in fact be obtained with relatively few securities as long as these securities could be traded continuously.\nIn his work on individual consumption and portfolio decisions, Huang provided a new approach to this classic economic topic. Many inherent dynamic optimization problems in this area have proved impossible to solve. Huang showed how these seemingly intractable problems can be broken into two easy-to-solve parts, one involving a static optimization problem and the other a dynamic problem without optimization.\nHuang's work on utility theory has allowed researchers to include in their models some intuitively appealing aspects of individual preferences that were previously ignored because they were too difficult to formalize. Additionally, he has expanded the applicability of auction theory to financial markets by studying price behavior in actions conducted by participants who are purchasing items for resale rather than for their own use."

The ECB had \"crossed the Rubicon\" and was in an untenable position, struggling to carry out its conflicting roles as agent of monetary policy, banking regulator, and Troika enforcer. Noting that the bank already held over \u20ac1 trillion of bonds bought at artificially low or negative yields, so would face great losses when interest rates rise again, he warned. The reputational risk of such actions by a central bank would have been unthinkable in the past.\" His conclusion was that in its current form the euro project was unworkable and one day would collapse.",

        "Introduction": "Neel Tushar Kashkari (born July 30, 1973) is an American banker, economist and politician who is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. As interim Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability from October 2008 to May 2009, he oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that was a major component of the U.S. government's response to the Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. A Republican, he unsuccessfully ran for Governor of California in the 2014 election.\nBorn and raised in Ohio, and educated at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Kashkari worked initially as an aerospace engineer. After attending business school at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he became an investment banker, covering the information technology security sector for Goldman Sachs.\nHenry Paulson, the former head of Goldman, and then Secretary of the Treasury, hired Kashkari on as an aide. Kashkari was eventually named Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Economics and Development. At Treasury, he played a number of roles in the response to the financial crisis and the subprime mortgage crisis that preceded it, most notably administering the TARP.\nKashkari left government and began working for Pimco in 2009, leading that company's push into the equities market. He resigned from Pimco in January 2013 to explore a run for public office. One year later, he announced his candidacy for Governor of California. He came in second in California's nonpartisan blanket primary but lost the general election to incumbent governor Jerry Brown.\nHe was named the new president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve November 10, 2015, succeeding Narayana Kocherlakota who announced his resignation in June.",
        "Early life and education": "Kashkari was born on July 30, 1973, in Akron, Ohio, to Sheila Kashkari, a pathologist at Akron City Hospital, and Chaman Kashkari, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Akron. His parents are Kashmiri Hindus who were born and raised in Srinagar in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and immigrated to the United States in 1964. They settled in Stow, a suburb of Akron, where Neel Kashkari grew up. His parents were well known within the local community of Indian Hindus. His older sister, Meera Kashkari Kelley, is a physician specializing in infectious diseases. Growing up, Neel's parents and sister were liberal, but his free-market views led him to identify more with the Republican Party.Kashkari attended Stow\u2013Munroe Falls High School before transferring to the Western Reserve Academy. He graduated in 1991 with honors in mathematics and was elected graduation speaker. In 2009, he described his high school grades as not good enough to apply to top-tier universities.Kashkari earned bachelor\u2019s (1995) and master\u2019s (1998) degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign. He was the team leader for the mechanical engineering component of the school's entry in the 1997 Sunrayce, a solar-powered vehicle race.",
        "Career": "No information",

There he worked on a stabilizing component for the James Webb Space Telescope.Kashkari left TRW to enter the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, earning an MBA in 2002. At Wharton he was president of the Finance Club and was part of the student organizing team for the annual Wharton Finance Conference.Kashkari interned at the investment bank Goldman Sachs during the summer between his two academic years at Wharton. After graduation from Wharton in 2002, he joined Goldman's San Francisco office as an associate covering software companies in the investment banking division. In this role, he was part of the team that advised clients on mergers and acquisitions, as well as other financial matters, until leaving the firm in 2006.He was a regional finalist for the White House Fellows program.",
        "Treasury Department": "In May 2006 President George W. Bush announced his intention to appoint Paulson as Secretary of the Treasury. Kashkari contacted Paulson and asked to join him at Treasury. Despite not knowing Kashkari well, Paulson agreed to meet with him, and much later offered him a job as a policy generalist. Kashkari accepted, and then Paulson remembered to confirm that Kashkari was a Republican. After the U.S. Senate confirmed Paulson, he and Kashkari started at Treasury on the same day. Kashkari was one of several Goldman employees who followed Paulson to Treasury.Kashkari began as a special assistant to Paulson working on energy policy. He and Allan B. Hubbard developed Bush's \"Twenty in Ten\" plan to promote energy conservation. He also worked on issues related to India, particularly infrastructure development. In November 2007, Bush nominated Kashkari to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Economics and Development. The U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination in June 2008, and Kashkari was sworn in the following month.",
        "2008 financial crisis": "By the summer 2007, concerns over the credit quality of private-label securitizations, underwriting standards and institutional solvency accelerated. The value of unconventional financial instruments backed by U.S. subprime mortgages declined sharply as it became clear that many of the borrowers would continue to default on the mortgages. This caused a housing glut and crisis as the banks holding the mortgages saw their assets decline in value and rushed to foreclose the loans. This ultimately intensified into a global financial crisis with broad implications.Kashkari played important roles in several episodes of the crisis. He led Treasury's participation in the Hope Now Alliance, a mortgage industry initiative coordinated by the federal government that aimed to reduce foreclosures by modifying loan terms on a loan-by-loan basis. In March 2008 he represented Treasury at negotiations that led ultimately to the federally sponsored takeover and rescue of the investment bank Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase. He was in charge of Treasury's (ultimately unsuccessful) efforts to create a market in the U.S. for covered bonds, whose value would continue to be guaranteed by the issuing bank after the bank had sold them. He also worked closely with Paulson on Treasury's takeover of the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on September 6, 2008, and the federal bailout of American International Group on September 16.In March 2008, Kashkari began to worry that, if the Bush administration never received the authority it needed to deal with the growing crisis, the next administration would blame them for everything wrong in the economy. Paulson scoffed at this idea, particularly Kashkari's speculation that Barack Obama, then a candidate in that year's presidential election, would win the presidency and use the crisis to ride to popularity just as former President Ronald Reagan had following the Iran hostage crisis.",
        "TARP": "In early 2008, Paulson directed Kashkari and fellow Treasury aide Phillip Swagel to write a plan to recapitalize the banking system in case the crisis worsened. The plan called for Congress to authorize Treasury to spend $500 billion to buy mortgage-backed securities from troubled banks, replacing them on banks' balance sheets with safe, liquid Treasury bills. This would prevent runs on the banks and encourage them to lend. The plan was conceived as an alternative to proposals from the staff of the House Financial Services Committee, then led by Democratic Representative Barney Frank.Following the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was enacted on October 3. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress voted for the law. Kashkari was one of several Paulson aides who was heavily involved in the crafting the legislation. Based in large part on Kashkari and Swagel's recapitalization plan, the EESA created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a $700 billion bailout fund for financial institutions threatened with collapse. Kashkari initially proposed a $1 trillion fund, but Paulson vetoed that number as too large. Kashkari came up with the lesser figure of $700 billion by taking 5% of the $14 trillion in then-outstanding mortgages in the United States.To administer TARP, the EESA created within the Treasury Department a new Office of Financial Stability to be headed by an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability, who would be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. However, it also specified that the Treasury Secretary could designate an interim Assistant Secretary to run the office. Kashkari first came to widespread public attention on October 6, 2008, when Paulson named him to this position. During his time running TARP he retained his title as Assistant Secretary for International Economics and Development, but his international affairs responsibilities were delegated to another Treasury official.Noticing a lack of necessary expertise in investment within Treasury, Kashkari recruited new staff for the program, some from government and others from industry, ultimately hiring about 100 people by January 2009. Kashkari also chaired the five-member investment committee within Treasury that decided which banks would receive TARP money.With Bush scheduled to leave office on January 20, 2009, following the November 2008 election, Kashkari's appointment was initially viewed as temporary. There were even plans to replace him before Bush left office. However, after Obama won the election, his transition team asked Kashkari to remain at Treasury after the inauguration for a limited period. He left the Treasury Department on May 1, 2009, replaced at the helm of TARP by Herbert M. Allison.During his time heading TARP, Kashkari was frequently called to testify before Congressional oversight panels. The House members would often question him hostilely over the politically unpopular program, but at least one, Representative Dennis Kucinich, assured Kashkari privately that he thought Kashkari was doing a great job. Another public critic, Representative Gregory Meeks, later thanked Kashkari for his service. Kashkari also won praise from Paulson and Timothy Geithner, Paulson's successor as Treasury Secretary and Kashkari's boss under the Obama administration. Neil Barofsky, who oversaw TARP within Treasury as a special inspector general, commended Kashkari's commitment to the job but criticized his actions. Elizabeth Warren, who headed TARP's Congressional Oversight Panel, later criticized Kashkari for allegedly promising to focus on smaller banks shortly before Treasury announced additional measures to bail out Citigroup. Kashkari later said that Bush not running for reelection allowed the government to \"do things that were deeply unpopular but we knew were the right thing.\"",
        "Return to California": "One week after his resignation, he and his wife moved to a cabin in rural Northern California near Lake Tahoe as part of what he called a \"detox\" from Washington. He worked on home improvement projects and helped Paulson write a memoir.In December 2009 Kashkari was named a managing director at the investment firm Pimco, in charge of new investment initiatives. Pimco, which had traditionally focused on bonds, hired him to broaden its focus into equities; Pimco later named him global head of equities. Kashkari had met Bill Gross, Pimco's co-founder, in December 2007 as part of his work at Treasury. Kashkari's move to Pimco attracted attention because Pimco benefited from the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, though it did not receive TARP funds. The six equity mutual funds Pimco launched under Kashkari all underperformed benchmarks in 2012. Kashkari attributed this to the funds hedging risk, which decreases returns when stock prices increase.Kashkari resigned from Pimco in January 2013, citing a desire to return to public service. He was expected to announce a campaign for elected office.In 2015, the Wall Street Journal said that \"the performance of [Pimco equity] funds Mr. Kashkari launched was spotty [and] the firm has since closed some of\" them.",
        "Politics": "No information",
        "2014 California gubernatorial campaign": "Kashkari has said he first considered running for Governor of California after Republican nominee Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election to Obama. He spent the year after his resignation from Pimco preparing to campaign in the 2014 gubernatorial election, touring the state, hiring a staff, and meeting with potential donors. He announced his candidacy on January 21, 2014, citing jobs and education as his top priorities. It was his first run for elected office. He finished second to incumbent governor Jerry Brown in the nonpartisan blanket primary and lost to Brown in the November general election. After the campaign, Kashkari published \"Lessons from the Trail,\" a firsthand account of what he learned from his gubernatorial campaign to help future candidates.",
        "Primary election": "Brown was widely expected to finish first in the primary, so Kashkari's principal opponent at this stage was his main rival for second place, Republican state assemblyman Tim Donnelly. Kashkari was seen as a fiscal conservative and social moderate, while Donnelly identified with the right-wing Tea Party movement.Kashkari enjoyed a significant funding advantage over Donnelly. He raised $1 million within two weeks of announcing his candidacy and went on to raise a total of US$4.1 million, including $2 million of his own money. Republican donors Charles Munger Jr. and Robert Addison Day also spent $400,000 supporting Kashkari through an independent expenditure committee. Donnelly raised only $447,000 in 2014.For most of the race, Kashkari trailed Donnelly in public opinion polls. Kashkari's moderate views on social issues, involvement with TARP, and vote for Obama in 2008 were unpopular with many Republican voters, who were more enthusiastic about Donnelly. Other Republicans feared that if Donnelly advanced to the general election he would not only lose to Brown but also hurt other Republicans running for office because of his narrow appeal to white conservatives, staunch right-wing views, inflammatory rhetoric, and criminal record. The perceived threat from Donnelly attracted endorsements for Kashkari from national Republicans including Romney, Jeb Bush, Condoleezza Rice, and Karl Rove, as well as California Republicans including Pete Wilson and Darrell Issa. These advantages allowed Kashkari not to campaign farther right than he wanted to.Kashkari's fundraising advantage allowed him pay for more advertising in the last weeks of the race. The first poll showing him ahead of Donnelly came out days before the election. In the June 3 primary, Kashkari came in second with 19% of the vote, and Donnelly came in third with 15%. Brown beat them both, with 55%.",
        "General election": "Brown, a Democrat, was long considered the favorite to win the general election. His approval ratings were high, and as of the end of the primary his campaign had US$21 million. Kashkari, by contrast, spent almost all his campaign money to beat Donnelly, and additional financial support from the national or state Republican Parties was unlikely. Kashkari cited George W. Bush's upset victory over Ann Richards in the 1994 election for Governor of Texas as a model for an upset against a popular Democratic governor.Kashkari lost the November 4, 2014 general election to Governor Jerry Brown by approximately 1.4 million votes, with Brown winning 60% of the vote. Brown won the largest gubernatorial victory since 1986 despite running a low-key campaign.",
        "Record of voting": "The San Francisco Chronicle reported in January 2014 that, since 1998, Kashkari had been eligible to vote in 23 elections in California and Pennsylvania but had only voted in 13 (i.e., 57%) of them. His campaign disputed some aspects of the reporting and said that Kashkari's Treasury Department service proves his commitment to civic life. Kashkari later acknowledged his imperfect voting record.",
        "Political positions": "Kashkari has been a Republican his whole life. In a 2008 speech to the American Enterprise Institute, Kashkari described himself as \"a free-market Republican.\" In 2013, he described himself as a \"pro-growth Republican\". He opposes most of Obama's economic agenda and supports cutting business regulations. He has called for cutting Social Security and Medicare and replacing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In 2012, he voted against California's Proposition 30, which raised taxes in the state, and for Proposition 32, which would have weakened labor unions' political influence. In a March 2014 interview, he praised Wisconsin governor Scott Walker's controversial policies limiting collective bargaining.On social issues, he has described himself as libertarian and \"a different kind of Republican\", supporting abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and a path to legal status for illegal immigrants. He voted against California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in 2008. In 2013, he was one of 131 Republicans who signed a pro-marriage equality amicus curiae brief submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court as part of Hollingsworth v. Perry, the case in which the final appeal against the previously-found unconstitutionality of Proposition 8 was rejected for lack of standing. Kashkari owns four guns and considers waiting periods and background checks before purchasing a firearm to be reasonable.On environmental issues, he voted against California's Proposition 23, which would have suspended the state law that limits greenhouse gas emissions. He believes climate change is real and man-made. He has spoken positively of fracking and offshore oil drilling and negatively of California's cap-and-trade program.Kashkari cites Paulson, Mitch Daniels, and Jeb Bush as political mentors. He voted for Obama in the 2008 presidential election and Romney in the 2012 election.In March 2014, Kashkari proposed waiving state income taxes for 10 years for businesses that move to California with at least 100 jobs; waiving state income taxes for California companies that build new manufacturing plants in the state; expanding hydraulic fracturing (fracking) of oil deposits; reducing environmental regulation; and increasing water storage in response to the state's ongoing drought. Economists and political experts interviewed by the Los Angeles Times were skeptical of the plan's chances in the Democratic-dominated California Legislature and of its potential effectiveness were it to be passed.In January 2020, Kashkari and Alan Page proposed amending a portion of the Minnesota State Constitution to read, \"All children have a fundamental right to a quality public education that fully prepares them.\"At a January 2021 Minneapolis Federal Reserve event on racism and the economy, Kashkari commented on the contrast between how the rioters at the U.S. Capitol were treated compared to black Americans, saying, \"If those were Black militants, armed militants, storming the U.S. Capitol, I think they\u2019d all be dead right now [ . . .] That is the most stark example of racism and disparities in our society.\u201d",
        "Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis": "In early November 2015 Kashkari was named president and CEO of the Minneapolis Fed. He was chosen by the Minneapolis bank board (excepting representatives from the financial industry), approved 5\u20130 by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and assumed the Minneapolis position on January 1, 2016. With the presidents of the New York (William C. Dudley), Dallas (Robert Steven Kaplan) and Philadelphia (Patrick T. Harker) regional Fed banks, Kashkari will become the fourth sitting regional Fed chief to have Goldman Sachs on his resume. Kaplan and Harker both assumed their positions in 2015.On February 16, 2016 while giving a speech at the Brookings Institution, Kashkari recommended that in order to stave another potential financial meltdown, the big banks should be broken up, saying, \"I believe the biggest banks are still too big to fail and continue to pose a significant, ongoing risk to our economy.\"",
        "Personal life": "Kashkari is a practicing Hindu. He said in 2009 that he began praying while working on TARP, having been especially affected when a colleague had a heart attack at work.Kashkari met his ex-wife Minal Jeshanker (now Kotterman) in college at the University of Illinois. They married in a traditional North Indian Hindu ceremony in Chicago, and she supported him through his time at Wharton while working as an engineer at Lockheed Martin Kashkari filed for divorce in November 2011 and later described the split as amicable. They have no children.Kashkari married Christine Ong in California\u2019s Sugar Pine Point State Park in August 2015. In February 2019, Kashkari and Ong welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Ulysses Sabine.",

    "Paul Kazarian": {
        "Introduction": "Paul B. Kazarian ( k\u0259-ZARR-ee-\u0259n; born October 15, 1955) is an Armenian-American investor, philanthropist, and former investment banker. He is the founder, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Japonica Partners, a private equity hedge fund. Previous to his founding of the firm, he was an investment banker for Goldman Sachs and briefly served as the president and CEO of Sunbeam-Oster from 1990 to 1993 as a corporate raider.\nHe is known for his bidding wars with high net worth individuals and companies to gain assets for his firm, most notably his bidding war against Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) for the acquisition of Borden. Kazarian is seen to be secretive about current or future investment decisions; he opens and closes positions without prior announcement or much after-trade commentary. He is considered by the investment community to be a \"vulture capitalist\". Due to its high buy-ins ($250 million), The Hedge Fund Journal called his fund a \"money manager for money managers\".During the 2013 Greek government-debt crisis, Kazarian become one of the largest bidders for Greek bonds, eventually executing a bond portfolio of \u20ac2.9 billion (US$3.8 billion). As the sole owner of the bond position, this portfolio makes up the majority of his overall net worth. On December 11, 2017, it was reported that Kazarian opened an office branch in Lisbon, Portugal tasked with \"snapping up assets\" in the country's real estate and technology markets.",
        "Early life and education": "Paul B. Kazarian was born on October 15, 1955, the son of immigrants from Armenia. His grandparents were Charles and Agnes Kazarian; both of them escaped the Armenian genocide. Kazarian grew up in an Armenian community in Pawtucket, Rhode Island\u2013a small mill town\u2014 and would go on to name his future investment fund after the street he grew up on: Japonica Street\u2013the name of a Japanese flower.He graduated from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, with a Bachelors of Arts, before attending Brown University to get a master's degree. He went on graduate from Columbia Business School with a M.B.A. During nights at Columbia, he interned at Goldman Sachs, after-which he was offered a full-time position at the firm in their investment banking division.",
        "Investment career": "No information",
        "Goldman Sachs & Co.": "In 1981, Kazarian was hired as a full-time investment banker at Goldman Sachs & Co. While at Goldman he worked with multinational investment clients and emerging markets. He often stayed up past 4 AM competing work during his time at the firm. He left Goldman in 1987.",

Through his earlier years with Japonica, Kazarian oversaw approximately $2 billion in shareholder wealth. The company specializes in under-performing global asset classes and undervalued investment positions.",
        "Sunbeam coup": "In 1990, Kazarian, then 37, was asked to serve out a three-year term as chairman and CEO of Sunbeam-Oster, after his private equity firm bought it out in a corporate raid. During his tenure he brought the company back from the verge of bankruptcy and created multiple profit streams for the company, ultimately returning it to profitability. His time as head of the company is used as a case study at Harvard Business School; Steven Fenster, a professor at Harvard University, has been quoted as labeling Kazarian as \"a mad genius\" with \"incredible\" business acumen. According to an article by The Wall Street Journal, employees at the firm viewed him as an \"overbearing boss whose frequent harangues and erratic, autocratic behavior made their lives miserable\". He often called top managers to \"crisis meetings\" at late hours in the night and encouraged inter-departmental competition. Top managers at the firm said that they were \"pitted against one another, publicly hazed, humiliated and even physically intimidated\". Roderick Hills, former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said of Kazarian: \"as Will Rogers said, no one is quite as good or quite as bad as they're supposed to be.\" In 1991, he was compensated with $1.84 million. During his tenure he was known to give bonuses to his top managers, sometimes spanning up to 20% of annual pay. Three years later, the board of directors compensated him with a pay package of $2.75 million. However, his management style was viewed as \"unacceptable\" in the coming years. Kazarian wanted to move the company headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee because of their relaxed tax structure over Rhode Island\u2013something he began to initiate without the board's approval.The board of directors of the company asked Kazarian to step down as CEO, but after his refusal and attempt to over take executives positions, his employment contract was suspended and eventually terminated. After his was fired, the company's stock dropped by 10% and took four months to recover\u2013however, trading volume for the stock was permanently expanded. Months after his dismissal from the company and return to Japonica, some of his associates at Sunbeam brought multiple lawsuits against him\u2013he won all of them, garnering a total of $160 million in settlements.",
        "Greek debt crisis trade": "After seeing southern European economic decline, he began to look at companies in the area to invest in. On a trip to Greece, he inquired about the government's financial statements; after hearing they did not assemble these statements, he began researching spending and debt ratios of the country. He noticed a difference between the reality of its economy and accounting figures prompting him to begin purchasing government bonds in June 2013 following the country's 2012 legislative elections. Kazarain did not disclose why he was buying these bonds to the Greek government or how much he was purchasing. His initial billion was purchased at 11 cents a bond, eventually concluding at 45 cents. The bonds would go on to be priced at 57/cent a share, marking considerable profit. Although Kazarian would only go on to execute $3.8 billion in bonds, he has insinuated that he has nearly $4 billion in his aggregate bond portfolio.During the 2013 Greek government-debt crisis, Kazarian become one of the largest bidders for Greek government bonds, eventually offering a bond portfolio of \u20ac2.9 billion euros (approximately $3.8 billion U.S. dollars). His offering was largely ignored by financial analysts and economists who labeled his trade \"risky and volatile.\" The government agreed to execute the trade at market price and purchased his partial bond portfolio. During the crisis he met with \"Greek finance ministers in Athens, top policy makers in Berlin, officials at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt and economists at the International Monetary Fund in Washington,\" according to The New York Times.",
        "Investment philosophy": "He is considered by the investment community to be a \"vulture capitalist\". He is known for buying out, taking over, or taking a position in distressed companies that face serious financial uncertainty\u2013in an effort to buy at a discount\u2013eventually making them profitable before selling. Due to its high buy-ins ($250 million), The Hedge Fund Journal called his fund a \"money manager for money managers\". During his Greek bond trade, he mentioned the accounting strategy he used to force the bond value rise. He said that there is an international standard for accounting that is not used by the European Union, instead opting for a legal framework that distorts the eurozone's financial positions\u2013meant for legal compliance not accountability. The conflation of \"future value\" as \"present value\" lead Kazarian to begin initiating his trade. He does not disclose specific investment positions or strategies to protect long-term deals and trades.",
        "Personal life": "Wiry and intense, Kazarian can come across as slightly offbeat. With the pink oxford shirts he wears every day, he deploys a plastic pocket protector that holds his collection of six pens and markers. His mien can veer from professorial to a bit manic, especially when he senses that someone is not quite grasping his line of reasoning.\nHe resides in a home in Providence, Rhode Island. Kazarian is known for his \"round, horn-rimmed glasses\" that have become his \"trademark\".On October 6, 2016, The Accountant, the International Accounting Bulletin, and Timetric granted Kazarian the special editors' award of global accountancy magazines for his contribution to strengthening democracy through government financial management.Kazarian has guest-lectured and spoken on the topics of business and philanthropy in settings ranging from the Harvard Business School, London Business School, Columbia Business School, and Dartmouth's Tuck Business School, to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the National School of Development at Peking University.",
        "Political and economic views": "Although Kazarian has not disclosed his own political affiliations, he has publicly commented on numerous issues.",
        "Views on Greek financial stability": "After his $3 billion government-debt rate he has commented on the need for financial and economic reform in Greece following the 2013 Greek government-debt crisis. He has called for the country to appoint a \"five-star finance minister\" with \"international-caliber five-star specialist training and capabilities to build trust and credibility.\" Kazarian has called for the country to adopt Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), when the Greek debt structure reaches 18% of GDP.",
        "Views on Greek debt": "He is an ardent supporter of the financial system of Greece. Often asserting that the country's debt is much lower than official reporting discloses, he notes government bonds as being profitable\u2014contrary to reports by the Bloomberg's World Bond Index. He has often stated that \"the method by which Greece's debt is calculated in the Eurozone is determined by the Maastricht Treaty and can change only with a unanimous decision by the European Council.\"\u2013leading to inflated or inaccurate net positions of countries. In an interview with Bloomberg Markets, he voiced his problem with nearly $19 billion being issued in debt-forgiveness for Greece but their debt ratings remaining the same. He believes that \"the Greek debt should be measured not at face value, which is 312 billion euros in 2015, but on a time of repayment basis, which would bring a substantial write-off due to low interest rates and the fact that its repayment will start in 10 years.\"",
        "Mario Draghi": "Kazarian has mentioned that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, faces too much pressure from \"the inaction and inability of politicians\" which minimizes the efficiency and effectiveness of the eurozone. He asserts the numerous \"badly managed\" European governments have rendered the office of the E.U. Central Bank politically pressured. His critique of Draghi's choice to lower zone interest rates was met with some controversy.",
        "Wealth and philanthropy": "During the 2013 Greek government-debt crisis, Kazarian made an official public offer to the government of Greece of a bond portfolio of 2.9 billion euros (approximately US$3.8 billion), and the government agreed to execute the trade, paying Kazarian full market price for his bonds. Many financial analysts speculate that Kazarian still has considerable holdings in Greek debt. As of December 2016, his net worth is between $4 billion and $4.1 billion.In 1993, Kazarian established two non-profit foundations whose charitable missions include economic development, education, and technology. The first, the Charles & Agnes Kazarian Eternal Foundation (CAKE) is named in honor of his grandparents. The CAKE Foundation seeks to \"empower families through economic development, education, and healthcare\". The second, The Kazarian Foundation, furthers similar goals. It announced a Knowledge Partnership with American India Foundation as part of a Knowledge Partnership initiative.\nKazarian was also committee chairman for a 2010 Singapore Heritage Celebration and on January 10, 2011, Kazarian delivered the opening address for a Knowledge Partnership for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Singapore Cooperation Programme. Kazarian is involved with the Asia Society, for which co-chaired the 2011 Awards Dinner.

He earned US$29.6 million during those three months, including a US$25 million golden parachute. He was subpoenaed by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo for his compensation.Kraus served as the chairman and chief executive officer of AllianceBernstein from December 2008 through May 2017, replacing Lewis A. Sanders.  Kraus joined the Axa Management Committee April 2010. He earned US$52 million during his first year.

        "Early career": "During his sophomore year, Kushner was founding executive editor of Scene, a new Brooks Brothers-sponsored student-publication that aimed to be \"Harvard's version of Vogue and Vanity Fair\". According to The Harvard Crimson, Scene \"faced blistering criticism upon its release\", with students going so far as creating a \"Scene Magazine is Bullshit\" Facebook group criticizing it for its \"completely ludicrous ... skewed portrayal of the Harvard community\" and \"lack of models who were minorities\".In the spring of his junior year, with two graduate students he pooled $10,000 to found social network Vostu, which aimed to \"fill a void left by online communities in which English is the lingua franca\", like Facebook. According to Kushner, Latin America was a promising market for a Facebook-alternative and new social networking site because \"[it was] a place where Internet use is increasing every year, and technology is booming at a rapid pace\". Vostu laid off the majority of its employees in 2013 and significantly scaled back its operations after a lawsuit from a competitor accused them of fraud, IP theft and copying games.The year after graduation, he also co-founded a start-up called Unithrive, with the cousin of the president of Kiva who was also a Harvard student. Unithrive was inspired by the peer-to-peer loan model of Kiva, but aimed to \"ease the crisis in paying for college\" by matching \"alumni lenders to cash-strapped students ... who [could] post photographs and biographical information and request up to $2,000\", interest-free for repayment within five years of graduation.

The day after he left Saudi, his brother Jared, and several other senior members of the Trump administration, visited and met with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Several ethics experts told The Times, that while the meeting was not illegal, it raised ethical concerns for Joshua and his brother as it was a potential conflict of interest.

        "Qatar Kushner Companies 666 Fifth Avenue Investment": "In June 2017, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had implemented a naval blockade on Qatar, accusing them of aiding terrorist groups, and reportedly planned to invade Qatar. During the dispute, Jared had backed the Saudis and Emiratis in the conflict, undermined efforts by then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to stop the blockade and to bring the conflict to a peaceful outcome, and pressured President Donald Trump to back the Emiratis and Saudis in the dispute, which the President did, according to the NYTimes.Kushner Companies, a firm that which Joshua serves as Principal Director, during the months prior to the blockage, had attempted to seek financing from the Qataris for their signature 666 Fifth Avenue property, which was facing a massive debt load in April 2017. Joshua's father, Charles Kushner, had met with Qatari finance minister, twice, to seek financing for the property. The deal fell through but ethics concerns were raised by US intelligence officials. Kushner Companies had, through 2015 and 2016, sought an additional $500 million from a Qatari billionaire and former Prime Minister but the deal fell through after Kushner Companies was not able to raise additional funding required for the $500 million investment. During the same week that his father was meeting with the Qatari finance minister in April 2017, Ali Shareef Al Emadi, Josh also met with Al Emadi, and pitched him on investing in Thrive Capital, which Ali Emadi declined. A Qatari source told The Intercept that it would have been \u201cmuch cheaper\u201d to simply pay Kushner for his failing investment and not suffer the blockade from Saudi/UAE (the blockade ended as soon as Trump left office in January). Tom Barrack, a private equity billionaire and close advisor to President Trump told The Washington Post in 2017 that he had tried to rescue the financing for 666 Fifth Avenue after the investment fell through and had called the former prime minister of Qatar and advised him that he should invest in the project which he still didn't.",

He was a director of AutoZone from 1999 to 2006. As of October 2021, his net worth was estimated at US$2 billion.",
        "Early life and education": "Lampert was born in 1962 to Dolores Lampert and Floyd M. Lampert. He is Jewish. His mother was a housewife. His father was a senior partner in the law firm of Lampert & Lampert in New York City. He has a younger sister Tracey. Lampert's grandmother was a passive investor and a fan of Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street Week television program. She instilled in him an interest in investing. His mother would later recall that young Eddie would sit with his grandmother reviewing and evaluating the performance of her stock picks in the daily newspaper.Lampert's father died in 1977, and his mother took a job as a clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue. His mother would later say: \"Eddie really assumed the responsibility, knowing that life had changed and we had to accomplish something by ourselves now.\" In order to help support his family, Lampert worked after school and on weekends at various warehouses, stocking shelves and filling orders. Despite working, he earned good grades, played both soccer and basketball, and won the scholar athlete award at his high school. He received financial aid to help pay for college. Lampert graduated from Yale University in 1984 with a bachelor's degree in economics, summa cum laude, where he was a member of Skull and Bones and Phi Beta Kappa.",
        "Career": "In July 1984, Lampert worked as an intern at Goldman Sachs, and then worked in the firm's risk arbitrage department from March 1985 to February 1988.  While there, he worked directly with Robert Rubin. When Lampert decided to go out on his own, Rubin warned him it would be a bad career decision.\nIn April 1988, Lampert left the bank to form ESL Investments, based in Greenwich, Connecticut (the name ESL derives from Lampert's initials). Richard Rainwater, whom Lampert had met on Nantucket Island, gave him $28 million in seed money and introduced him to clients, such as David Geffen.\nLampert typically holds his investments for several years and usually has between three and fifteen stocks in his portfolio. His investment style has drawn comparisons to the financier Warren Buffett.Lampert's earnings in 2004 were estimated to be $1.02 billion, making him the first Wall Street financial manager to exceed an income of $1 billion in a single year. In 2006, Lampert was featured on the Time 100 list for most influential people in the world for being one of the \"brightest minds on Wall Street\" and leading a new class of activist hedge funds.

Early in the year, he committed to providing an additional loan of $500 million to Sears and said he would provide letters of credit to Sears for additional amounts, reportedly totaling $200 million and possibly increasing to a half billion dollars in the future.He has been criticized by employees and corporate staff for \"shredding\" his employees in corporate meetings and \"being out of touch with reality,\" as well as for failing to invest in the physical stores, as many of them are deteriorating. During his tenure as CEO, Sears lost around half its value within five years, and closed more than half of its physical stores.\nOn October 15, 2018, Lampert stepped down as CEO of Sears Holdings, while remaining chairman of the board, as part of Sears Holdings bankruptcy actions. On December 6, 2018, Lampert, through his company ESL Investments, offered to buy all of Sears for $4.6 billion in cash and stock. The offer would be financed by $950 million in added debt, but no additional cash. In early 2019, five hundred stores remained in operation; the remainder were in liquidation. According to a company filing, Lampert stepped down as chairman of Sears Holdings Corp on February 14, 2019.In January 2019, a group of Sears' creditors hoping to persuade a federal judge to force Sears to liquidate alleged that Lampert had orchestrated a \"multiyear and multifaceted scheme\" to strip away the company's assets and benefit from its decline. In May 2019, Lampert, months after purchasing the remains of Sears from the holding company, threatened not to pay out the $43 million in pension payments owed to 90,000 former Sears and Kmart employees and retirees.",

He served from 1993 to 2001 as the twenty-fifth and longest-serving chairman of the commission.  Widely hailed as a champion of the individual investor, he has been criticized for not pushing for tougher accounting rules. Since May 2001 he has been employed as a senior adviser at the Carlyle Group.  Levitt previously served as a policy advisor to Goldman Sachs and is a Director of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News.",
        "Early life and career": "Levitt grew up in a Jewish family in Brooklyn. Levitt's father, Arthur Levitt Sr., served as New York State Comptroller for 24 years and was sole trustee of the largest pension fund in America at the time. Levitt attended Brant Lake Camp, a summer camp for boys in the Adirondacks. He attended and graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn in 1948.\nHe graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Williams College in 1952, before serving for two years in the Air Force. He first worked as a drama critic for The Berkshire Eagle, and after the Air Force, he was with Time-Life for five years before selling cattle and ranches as tax shelters.In 1963, Levitt joined the brokerage firm Carter, Berlind & Weill, founded three years earlier by Sanford I. Weill.  Levitt's name was eventually added to the firm's when it was renamed Cogan, Berlind, Weill & Levitt in the mid-1960s; through a series of mergers the firm eventually evolved into Shearson Loeb Rhoades. This experience with retail customers was a source of his interest in the small investor. After sixteen years on Wall Street, Levitt became the Chairman of the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in 1978. In 1989, he left the AMEX to serve as Chairman of the New York City Economic Development Corporation until 1993.Before joining the SEC, Levitt owned Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Capitol Hill, which he purchased from the paper's founder, Sid Yudain, in 1986. The newspaper was eventually sold to The Economist for $15 million in 1993.",
        "Chairman of the SEC": "Levitt was appointed to his first five-year term as Chairman of the SEC by President Clinton in July 1993 and reappointed in May 1998. He left the Commission on February 9, 2001, and was succeeded by Harvey Pitt.  Levitt has said that he first learned of his being considered for the job from The Wall Street Journal.At the time Levitt came to the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) had proposed requiring companies to record stock options on their income statements, which split the accounting industry and was opposed by many in the American business community.  According to a Merrill Lynch study, expensing stock options would have reduced profits among leading high-tech companies by 60% on average.  Congress began to exert pressure on the FASB, and on May 3, 1994, the Senate, led by Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman, offered a non-binding resolution urging FASB not to adopt the proposed rule; the vote in favor was 88\u20139.  Concerned that insensitivity to this sentiment in Congress might threaten FASB as an independent standard setter, Levitt urged the FASB to not go ahead with the rule proposal.  He later said this \"was probably the single biggest mistake I made in my years at the SEC.\"In September 1998 at New York University, he gave a speech entitled \"The Numbers Game\". It addressed five ways in which corporations were managing earnings (big bath charges, creative acquisition accounting, cookie-jar reserves, materiality, revenue recognition).  In his speech, Levitt advocated improving the transparency and comparability of financial statements.In 1997, the SEC under Levitt's leadership approved the exemption of some Enron partnerships from the tight accounting controls of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Without this exemption, critics maintain, the company would have been constrained by strict rules found in 1996 legislation that would have prohibited certain foreign investments and the shifting of debt to its foreign subsidiary shell companies.During Levitt's tenure at the SEC, he was widely viewed as a pro-investor advocate and received favorable press coverage.",
        "After the SEC": "Levitt serves on the Board of Directors for RiskMetrics Group.In 2005, Levitt was named a special advisor to the American International Group's board of directors and the board's nominating and corporate governance committee following the resignation of CEO and Chairman Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, who left after an investigation into the firm's accounting practices by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.Levitt oversaw an audit published in August 2006, by Kroll Inc. \u2013 where he is a consultant \u2013 describing how the City of San Diego had allowed a pension deficit of $1.43 billion.

The Black\u2013Litterman model solves this problem by making expected returns an output, rather than an input, in the model. The model combines information from market equilibrium with views about returns of assets or combinations of assets, in order to generate the expected returns.\nThe Black\u2013Litterman model has become one of the standard models widely used by investors around the world to optimize portfolios. Litterman is the author of Modern Investment Management: An Equilibrium Approach, together with Goldman Sachs Asset Management's Quantitative Resources Group.",

Matsui joined the Japan Strategy team of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in spring 1990, just after the Japanese bubble economy peaked.  She joined Goldman Sachs Japan in 1994, where she became managing director in 1998 and the first female partner there in 2000.In August 1999 Matsui published a thesis in which she coined the term \"womenomics\", in which she argues increasing the participation of women in the workforce as a better solution to Japan's economic stagnation than increasing immigration or the birthrate.  At the time, 56.7% of working-age women participated in the workforce in Japan, where women's status and opportunities have ranked low compared to most other nations.  She likened such low participation to \"running a marathon with one leg\".Since her publication on womenomics, Japan\u2019s female labor force participation rate has risen to record levels that surpass both the US and Europe. The narrowing of the gender employment gap in Japan could thus sizably increase the nation's GDP by at least 10%.\nIn 2001, Matsui was diagnosed with breast cancer.  She returned to California for chemotherapy and recuperation.  She wore a wig when she returned to Goldman Sachs eight months later.Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe incorporated Matsui's womenomics research into his Abenomics economic reforms announced in 2012.  On 1 January 2015 she was appointed a vice chair of Goldman Sachs Japan.She is an advocate for women and pushes to enforce the vitality of women across all workspaces supported by policy and legislative recommendations. She lobbies for flexible labor contracts, tax reforms, looser immigration laws, and parliamentary gender quotas.\nIn 2014 Matsui was named \"50 Most Influential\" in Bloomberg Markets magazine for her implementation of \"womenomics\" into the field of investment banking and straight into her workplace at Goldman Sachs.By 2020, she terminated her job at Goldman Sachs to pursue MPower Partners Fund. In 2021, she announced the creation of MPower Partners Fund - an entirely female-led fund that aims to allocate money towards startups. The capital that is allocated through the fund pushes towards investing in startups that use technology to tackle social issues with an emphasis on those that tackle health, education, and the environment. Creating this foundation emphasized Matsui's revolution of womenomics and instated it as a core value in the fund. Matsui aims to not only diversify the world of venture capital, but also to meet levels of diversity at the first stage of a startups' business cycle.",
        "Recognition": "The magazine Institutional Investor named her the No. 1 stock market forecaster for Japan in 2000, 2001, and 2006, and the Wall Street Journal chose her in 2007 as one of \"10 Women to Watch in Asia\".",

He also served as chairman of bullion producer AngloGold Ashanti, among other company directorships.",
        "Minister of Finance, 2018\u20132021": "On 9 October 2018, Mboweni was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa as the new Minister of Finance of the Republic of South Africa with immediate effect following Nhlanhla Nene's resignation.  From the beginning of his tenure Mboweni often found himself at odds with the ruling ANC policy and ideology.  The ruling ANC has always inclined itself towards socialist policies, a stance which has been viewed as a form of appeasing its alliance partners, the South African Communist Party and COSATU. On the other hand, Mboweni has continuously proffered liberal solutions such as his 2019 economic recovery growth plan which has been rejected by SACP and COSATU.His economic growth plan was widely criticised in the Public Sector. In an opinion piece, Telkom Group CEO Sipho Maseko slammed Mboweni's proposed reforms for the ICT sector, particularly plans related to the rollout of spectrum, as being \"ill-thought-out\". However the response was different in the private sector, CEO of Bridgement Daniel Goldberg during his Sage tour to Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Durban hailed the plan, saying \"it will improve the rate at which big state owned enterprises pays its suppliers consequently increasing efficiency in the economy.    Phumlani Majozi in his opinion piece on Finance 24 argued that \"Mboweni's ideas on how to revamp this economy, presented in his recent paper, titled \"Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth and Competitiveness: Towards an Economic Strategy for South Africa\", are what will get this country back on track.\"In June 2020, Mboweni proposed a new austerity policy, to cut the state's wage bill of R160.2 billion over three years and to adopt a Zero-based budget system in order to avoid a sovereign debt crisis in 2024.On 5 August 2021, Mboweni resigned as finance minister.

    "Evan McMullin": {
        "Introduction": "David Evan McMullin (born April 2, 1976) is an American politician and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer. McMullin ran as an independent in the 2016 United States presidential election and in the 2022 United States Senate election in Utah.McMullin was a CIA operations officer from 2001 to 2010. In 2011, he received an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and worked as an investment banker for about a year and a half. He was a senior adviser on national security issues for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs from 2013 to 2015 and served as a chief policy director for the House Republican Conference in the U.S. House of Representatives from January 2015 through July 2016. McMullin left the Republican Party in 2016 after Donald Trump became the party's presumptive presidential nominee.\nMcMullin ran for president in the 2016 election as an independent backed by the organization Better for America. He received support from some members of the \"Never Trump\" movement, and polling taken late in the campaign showed him ahead of major party nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in his home state of Utah. McMullin received 21.5% of the vote in Utah, taking third place in that state behind Trump and Clinton. Nationally, he received 0.53% of the popular vote.Following his defeat, McMullin emerged as a vocal critic of the Trump administration. He endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. He has been involved in early discussions about forming a new center-right political party, and organized the May 2021 release of the political manifesto \"A Call for American Renewal\" with Miles Taylor. In 2022, McMullin launched a campaign as an independent in the U.S. Senate election in Utah, receiving the endorsement of the Utah Democratic Party. He was defeated in the November 8 general election by incumbent Republican Mike Lee, losing by an unexpectedly close margin of 11%.",
        "Early life and education": "McMullin was born in Provo, Utah, the oldest of four children of David McMullin and Lanie Bullard. At a young age, his family moved to a rural area outside Seattle, Washington, where his father worked as a computer scientist and his mother sold bulk foods to neighbors from the family's garage. After graduating in 1994 from Auburn Senior High School, McMullin spent two years in Brazil as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Upon returning, he spent a summer working on an Alaskan fishing vessel.\nIn 1997, McMullin began attending Brigham Young University (BYU); every year he was in college he did a summer internship with the CIA. He spent a year living in Israel and Jordan and volunteered as a refugee resettlement officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In 2001, McMullin graduated with a bachelor's degree in international law and diplomacy and began formal training with the CIA to become an operations officer. After working for the CIA, McMullin attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania where he received an MBA in 2011.",
        "Career": "No information",
        "CIA intelligence officer": "Soon after McMullin joined the CIA, the September 11 attacks occurred, leading to an accelerated training and deployment. He spent the next decade working overseas on counterterrorism and intelligence operations as an operations officer with the National Clandestine Service in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia. He was first deployed in 2003 and left the agency in 2010. His deployments included postings in an unspecified southwest Asian country that was key to the-ongoing War on Terror.While the details of his missions remain classified, former CIA officers who worked with McMullin praised his work, noting his talent for recruiting members of extremist organizations through building trust and willingness to engage in human intelligence outside the confines of the embassy. His former supervisor said that U.S. intelligence goals at that time included information-gathering for efforts against the Taliban, developing intelligence for counter-terrorism strikes, and searching for information leading to Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders. Near the end of his CIA career, he worked undercover in Iraq. McMullin said his work involved meeting with business and government leaders, as well as collecting information from terrorist operatives.",
        "Career in business and as House staffer": "After leaving the CIA, McMullin attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, earning his MBA in 2011. McMullin then worked for the Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs for about a year and a half. In 2012, he volunteered for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, which indirectly led to him being recruited by Republicans on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs looking for an adviser with counter-terrorism experience. In 2013, McMullin was an International Advisory Board member for the Kennedy Center for International Studies at BYU.In 2013, McMullin became a senior adviser on national security issues for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for the 113th Congress. In 2015, McMullin became the chief policy director of the House Republican Conference under Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.). It was from this position that he watched the 2016 Republican primaries, and when he began to speak out against Trump he was urged by some Republicans to stay out of the fray. McMullin resigned as chief policy director shortly before declaring his run for the presidency in August 2016.",
        "Political activity": "No information",
        "2016 presidential campaign": "On August 8, 2016, McMullin announced that he would run as a candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election as an independent. He had personally lobbied several Congresspeople to run under the Better for America banner, but when none would run and it was suggested to him that he should run himself, he decided to do so.McMullin ran as an independent conservative alternative to Trump, and had the support of several anti-Trump Republican donors and his presidential bid was also backed by several former members of Better for America, a 501(c)(4) organization dedicated to getting nationwide ballot access for an independent candidate for president in the 2016 election. McMullin's campaign was supported by some members of the \"Never Trump\" movement.In September 2016, McMullin said Trump \"poses a true threat to our national security by carrying Putin's water in the United States\" and criticized Russian government activities to promote Trump and his allies, saying that these activities undermined the U.S. and global economies and were destructive to peace and security. He criticized Russian disinformation campaigns that targeted Western Europe and North America \"through fomenting discord between different racial groups, different ethnic groups, and different religious groups.\" He criticized Republican congresspeople who publicly supported Trump while privately expressing alarm at Trump's actions and statements, saying that many Republican officials were \"afraid to speak out against\" Trump for fear of losing their seats, and said: \"Anyone who supports Donald Trump is someone who I think is not too committed to the constitution. I believe Donald Trump poses a true threat to our constitution and those who support him are sustaining that threat.\" In a December 2016 rally, Trump attacked McMullin, referring to him as \"McMuffin\" and saying, \"I never even heard of this guy before. Nobody did.\"McMullin's late entrance into the race caused him to miss several state ballot deadlines, and ultimately he was only able to appear on the ballot in eleven states, with write-in eligibility in many other states. As such he did not appear on enough ballots to win the necessary Electoral College majority of 270 electoral votes, so instead McMullin hoped to deny a majority of the electoral vote to either of the two major-party candidates. In such a scenario, under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment, the House of Representatives would select the new president from among the top-three electoral vote winners.The same day that McMullin launched his independent bid, Kahlil Byrd and Chris Ashby, Republican strategists with expertise in third-party ballot access, announced the formation of a super PAC called Stand Up America to support McMullin's campaign via TV and digital ads, events, and organizing.On October 6, McMullin named Mindy Finn as his running mate. Finn had previously worked for Twitter and as a digital strategist for the RNC and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Because Finn's selection came after the ballot paperwork deadlines, Finn did not appear on any of the state ballots. Instead, McMullin's friend's name, Nathan Johnson, was submitted as a placeholder.McMullin's support surged in Utah in October after the release of a 2005 audio recording in which Donald Trump was heard bragging in lewd terms about making sexual advances on women. McMullin's popularity in Utah \u2013 and Trump's unpopularity \u2013 appears owing to an unusual shift of Mormons away from the Republican candidate. Prognosticators gave McMullin a 3%-10% chance of winning the state. Had McMullin won Utah, it would have been the first time since 1968 that a non-major-party candidate won a state.Ultimately, McMullin's best performance came in Utah, his native state, where he came in third place, receiving 21.54% of the state's popular vote, behind both Donald Trump (who received 45.54% and the state's six electoral votes) and Hillary Clinton (who received 27.46%). He also took third in Idaho with 6.7%. Nationwide, McMullin received 734,737 votes (0.54%). After the election, McMullin said that \"the fight would continue\" for a \"new conservative movement\" reaching out to \"non-traditional conservative voters ... who feel disaffected\". It might, he said, form a new political party.While running for president in 2016, McMullin's campaign amassed about $664,000 in debt to campaign vendors, mostly from legal fees. It is common for unsuccessful presidential campaigns to incur such debts, and in 2022, McMullin said he was committed to paying down the debts. Utah businessman and former Republican Kimball Parker Dean wrote that McMullin's 2022 Senate campaign raised the possibility that he could use the funds he raises to pay those debts.",
        "After the 2016 campaign through 2021": "After the 2016 campaign, McMullin has continued to be strongly critical of Trump and Putin. In a December 2016 op-ed, McMullin attacked Trump as a threat to American constitutional government, saying that the president-elect's actions were \"consistent with the authoritarian playbook\" and \"undermined critical democratic norms including peaceful debate and transitions of power, commitment to truth, freedom from foreign interference and abstention from the use of executive power for political retribution\".In January 2017, McMullin and his former running mate Finn announced the establishment of a 501(c)(4) organization, Stand Up Republic. The group, a nonpartisan organization, was formed as a watchdog group criticizing Trump administration on democracy issues. The group focuses on \"defense of democratic (small 'd') norms, constitutionalism and civic involvement\". Speaking on so-called \"alternative facts\" McMullin said: \"Undermining truth is a typical authoritarian tactic. It is incredibly dangerous ... We never thought we'd be talking about this in America.\" In a February 2017 op-ed, McMullin wrote, \"President Trump's disturbing Russian connections present an acute danger to American national security.\" He called upon congressional Republicans to \"recommit to patriotic prudence\" and \"demand that Attorney General Jeff Sessions appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Russia's assault on American democracy and Mr. Trump's possible collusion with the Kremlin\".In 2020, McMullin endorsed Joe Biden over Trump in the 2020 presidential election, writing that \"We now face a choice between the road to freedom and the road to tyranny. ... I'll put country over party in November.\" He was involved in early discussions with dozens of former Republican officials about forming a new center-right political party, and organized the May 2021 release of the political manifesto \"A Call for American Renewal\" with Miles Taylor.",
        "2022 U.S. Senate campaign": "On October 5, 2021, McMullin launched an independent campaign to unseat U.S. Senator Mike Lee in the 2022 election.  He announced his candidacy in the Deseret News, writing, \"We do not need the extremists, the dividers, or the self-serving opportunists who haunt the halls of Congress today. We need selfless, servant leaders who unite rather than divide, seek solutions rather than attention, and who will consistently put the interests of Utahns and our country first. That's why I'm running to replace Sen. Mike Lee and to represent Utah, and our values, in the United States Senate.\" McMullin named \"our unmooring from truth\" as the greatest threat to America, specifically condemning conspiracism, misinformation, and divisiveness as threats to American democracy.Two high-profile Utah Democratic officials, former Representative Ben McAdams and Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson, endorsed McMullin by March 2022. In April 2022, both the Utah chapter of the American Solidarity Party and the Utah Democratic Party decided to endorse McMullin's independent candidacy for Senate, rather than field candidates of their own. McMullin pledged, if elected, to caucus with neither the Democrats nor the Republicans. Utah's other U.S. Senator, Mitt Romney, stayed neutral in the race. Lee was favored to win the race, as most (but not all) polls showed Lee with a single-digit lead over McMullin; the race was viewed as unusually competitive for Utah, which is typically a deeply Republican state.McMullin lost the election to Lee 53.2%-42.8%, but had the best performance by a Non-Republican since 1976, giving Lee the worst performance by a Republican since 1974 losing 15 points in a stark contrast to his re-election in 2016 where he won with 68.2% of the vote.",
        "Political positions": "McMullin speaks out against partisanship and extremism in politics, stating that those extremes do not accurately represent Utah or the country as a whole, and has embraced being an independent. He says that extremism is jeopardizing American government.",
        "Economic issues": "McMullin supports free trade, pointing to the economic benefits of international trade. He supported NAFTA of 1994 and the original Trans-Pacific Partnership.McMullin supports a reduction in the corporate income tax and individual income tax, as well as the estate tax.McMullin favors cuts to entitlement programs such as Social Security, and has proposed means-testing the program and raising the retirement age.",
        "Environmental issues": "McMullin accepts the scientific consensus on climate change, saying: \"I do believe that the climate is changing, and I do believe that human activity is contributing to it. If I were president, I would increase investment in technologies that can help us limit and decrease our carbon emissions.\"",
        "Foreign and national security policy": "On the Syrian Civil War, McMullin described himself as a \"vocal advocate for international action that would stop Assad's slaughter of innocent Syrians, and eventually set the stage for a negotiated departure from the country\". McMullin also has said: \"We should have done more to support the moderate Syrian opposition, and we still need to do that. They haven't received sufficient support or training, and we know how to do that very well.\" In 2016, McMullin expressed support for imposing a no-fly zone over Syria \"to stop the aerial bombardment of Syrian population centers\".McMullin opposes the use of torture, while supporting keeping the Guantanamo Bay detention camp open.McMullin has harshly criticized the international nuclear agreement with Iran. He stated: \"We've got to certainly enforce the deal as it is, but I believe in strengthening sanctions on Iran to force them to make further concessions. I also believe in putting the military option clearly back on the table if Iran decides to not keep its end of the deal and if it ultimately decides to pursue nuclear weapons.\"McMullin told ABC News that he believed Donald Trump's public comments were frustrating U.S. counterterrorism efforts. \"What he doesn't realize is that we actually depend on Muslims to do counterterrorism, to wage war against terrorists.\" Trump's remarks concerning Muslims \"decreases their willingness to work with us, with other Muslims, and that impedes our ability to destroy ISIS\". McMullin also criticized Trump's \"allegiance to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin\" and accused Putin of engaging in a campaign to destabilize European and North American countries \"through fomenting discord between different racial groups, different ethnic groups, and different religious groups\".In 2014, McMullin helped to bring Caesar, a defected Syrian military photographer who leaked 55,000 images depicting abuses by the regime (which formed the basis for the 2014 Syrian detainee report), to speak before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, according to The Christian Science Monitor. McMullin clashed with State Department officials he suspected were holding up the hearing. McMullin claimed that State Department officials wanted to have a closed hearing.",
        "Social issues": "McMullin supported overturning Roe v. Wade in 2016.  After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, McMullin issued a statement saying, \"I believe the never-ending conflict over abortion laws threatens a public health crisis and further divide the country on an issue where there is common ground.\" He described himself as \"pro-life\" and said that he \"opposed politicians at the extremes of both parties on the issue, those who would ban all abortions without exceptions and those who oppose all restrictions.\" McMullin said that states should be largely responsible for setting abortion policy and supported Utah's abortion trigger law as \"a good starting place.\" He criticized \"extreme\" state laws enacted after Dobbs, including bans on all abortions, and said that the federal government should act to block laws that ban abortions for victims of rape, ban residents from traveling to obtain an abortion, and ban contraceptives. McMullin added, \"When we do more to help women and children, abortions decline. Making contraceptives more available and otherwise doing much more to support families is what truly protects life.\" The statement echoed McMullin's past calls for more policies that support women, children and families. McMullin said that, if elected, he would vote against bills to ban abortion nationwide.  In previous statements, McMullin said there was common ground between Americans who support and oppose abortion rights, criticized the divisive \"never-ending tug-of-war\" of the abortion debate, and noted that the number of U.S. abortions has been declining for years.On same-sex marriage, McMullin said that he believes in the \"traditional marriage between a man and a woman\" but he \"respects\" the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (which found that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry) and thinks it is \"time to move on\" from the issue. McMullin's mother is in a same-sex marriage, having married another woman after separating from his father, and McMullin has said, \"As far as my mother's marriage is concerned, I believe in the sanctity of traditional marriage. It is an important part of my faith. My mother has a different view. That is OK. I love her very much.\"",
        "Other domestic issues": "During his 2016 presidential campaign, McMullin said that if elected, he would appoint originalist judges to the Supreme Court, \"in the mold of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas\".On immigration, McMullin supports border security but not mass deportation. He criticized immigration policy based on family reunification, taking the position that U.S. economic policy should be based on serving the nation's economic interests by attracting the talented.In 2016, McMullin expressed support for the provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that blocks health insurance companies from denying coverage or discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. However, he also stated, \"we also need to do better than ObamaCare.\" McMullin has also supports allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs.",
        "Personal life": "McMullin is a member of the LDS Church.In June 2021, McMullin married Emily Norton. He has five stepchildren from his wife's previous marriage (her first husband died of brain cancer in 2016). The family lives in Highland, Utah."

Mnuchin has stated: \"In no way did I use [offshore entities] to avoid U.S. taxes.\"",
        "OneWest": "No information",
        "Purchase of IndyMac and other loan portfolios": "In 2009, a group led by Mnuchin bought California-based residential lender IndyMac, which had been in receivership by the FDIC and owned $23.5 billion in commercial loans, mortgages, and mortgage-backed securities. The purchase price was a $4.7 billion discount to its book value. Mnuchin's investment group included George Soros, hedge-fund manager John Paulson, former Goldman Sachs executive J. Christopher Flowers, and Dell Computer founder Michael Dell. The FDIC agreed to retain some of the more problematic assets of the bank, and signed a loss-sharing agreement. The FDIC was estimated to be required to pay $2.4 billion to IndyMac under the shared loss agreement. After purchasing IndyMac, renamed OneWest Bank, Mnuchin moved into a 20,000 square foot house in Bel Air to begin his tenure as CEO and chairman. OneWest then bought several other failed banks including First Federal Bank of California in 2009 and La Jolla Bank in 2010. Furthermore, OneWest bought a portfolio belonging to Citi Holdings for $1.4 billion. OneWest was profitable one year after Mnuchin had bought it, and it became the largest bank of Southern California, with assets worth $27 billion.",
        "Sale to CIT": "In 2015, Mnuchin sold OneWest to CIT Group for $3.4 billion. After the acquisition by CIT, Mnuchin remained at OneWest, and became a member of CIT Group's board of directors. As of August 2016, Mnuchin owned $97 million in CIT Group stock, most of which he had received in exchange for his stake in OneWest. On December 2, 2016, Mnuchin resigned from the board of directors of CIT as a result of his selection as nominee for Secretary of the Treasury.",
        "Foreclosures": "OneWest was criticized for aggressively foreclosing on homeowners. In the five years following Mnuchin's acquisition of OneWest, the bank foreclosed on 36,000 homes in California, leading local activists to begin calling Mnuchin \"the foreclosure king.\" The high foreclosure rate might have been a result of the loss sharing agreement with the FDIC, whereby the FDIC had to reimburse OneWest for losses. According to The New York Times, OneWest \"was involved in a string of lawsuits over questionable foreclosures, and settled several cases for millions of dollars\". Because of these foreclosures, around 100 protesters of Occupy Los Angeles gathered outside Mnuchin's home in October 2011 and held signs that read \"Make Banks Pay\". Two California fair-housing groups filed complaints to the federal government alleging that OneWest had violated the Fair Housing Act by not lending money to African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians.In November 2016, after OneWest was sold to CIT, the California Reinvestment Coalition submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to learn more about CIT's reverse mortgage subsidiary, Financial Freedom. According to the HUD's response, CIT/Financial Freedom foreclosed on 16,220 federally insured reverse mortgages from April 2009 to April 2016. This represented about 39% of all federally insured reverse mortgage foreclosures during that time. CRC estimated that Financial Freedom serviced only about 17% of the market and thus was foreclosing more than twice as often as its competitors. CIT Group disclosed to investors that it had received subpoenas from HUD's Office of the Inspector General in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. In November 2016, two non-profits filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleging redlining by OneWest Bank.In 2017 a leaked internal memo from the California attorney general's office was published, stating that the prosecutor's office had found more than a thousand violations of foreclosure law by OneWest during Mnuchin's tenure. The prosecutor, Kamala Harris, had declined to file a civil enforcement suit.",
        "Liberty Strategic Capital": "After Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, Mnuchin established an investment fund, Liberty Strategic Capital. The fund obtained funds from the Saudis, Emirati and Qatari sovereign wealth funds. According to the New York Times, \"The scale of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s fund and its investments from countries where he traveled as Treasury secretary have raised questions about whether he used his government role to enrich himself.\"",
        "Film production career": "In 2004, Mnuchin founded Dune Entertainment as a side business. It financed a number of large-budget films, mostly for 20th Century Fox, including the X-Men film franchise and Avatar. In 2012, after Dune's deal with 20th Century Fox ended, Mnuchin worked with the filmmaker Brett Ratner and the Australian businessman James Packer to merge his Dune Entertainment company with Ratner and Packer's newly founded RatPac Entertainment joint venture. This formed RatPac-Dune Entertainment, which agreed a financing deal with Warner Bros. \nBetween 2013 and 2018, RatPac-Dune financed many films for Warner Bros., including American Sniper and Mad Max: Fury Road. Mnuchin was co-chairman of the trio's movie company, Relativity Media, but left seven months before it went bankrupt. A source close to the company said he had resigned because of the potential for a conflict of interest between his duties at Relativity and OneWest. He and other investors reportedly lost $80 million.",

His contributions to candidates included 11 donations to Republicans and 36 donations to Democrats.

Earlier in 2016, Mnuchin had donated $4,000 to Democrats Kamala Harris and Michael Wildes.",
        "2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump": "Mnuchin was an early supporter of Trump, and attended his victory party after the New York Republican primary victory on April 19, 2016, for which he received a last-minute invitation. He was called the following day by Trump, who asked him if he wanted to be the national finance chairman of his campaign. Mnuchin, who later said in an interview he had known Trump \"for over fifteen years\", accepted the offer. In a statement announcing the appointment, Trump said: \"Steven is a professional at the highest level, with an extensive and very successful financial background.\" He also said Mnuchin would bring \"unprecedented experience and expertise\" that would benefit the Republican Party. After being appointed as the Trump campaign's main fundraiser, Mnuchin said: \"It's a great privilege to be working with Mr. Trump to create a world-class finance organization to support the campaign in the General Election.\"Mnuchin worked with Republican National Committee counterpart Lewis Eisenberg on a late-developing joint operation for the committee and the Trump campaign. Before Mnuchin's appointment, no large-scale fundraising operation had been started for the Trump campaign. The late-summer fundraising goal was close to $500 million. The New York Times described Mnuchin's role during the campaign as \"relatively behind the scenes\", and the newspaper noticed he never \"seemed to seek the spotlight\". During an interview, Mnuchin said that because of his connection to the Trump campaign, \"a lot of people in California and New York [...] wanted to stop being friends\". After Trump won the election, he announced that Mnuchin would join the transition team on November 11.",
        "Political views": "In a November 30, 2016, interview on CNBC, Mnuchin called it the Trump administration's job to \"make sure that the average American has wage increases and good jobs\". Furthermore, he said his priority was getting a sustained growth of GDP of 3% or 4%. He said in order to get there, \"our number one priority is tax reform\". Mnuchin said he would reduce corporate taxes to 15%, cut taxes for the middle class, and simplify the tax system. When asked about trade, he said he believed in trade deals with individual countries, as opposed to regional trade deals. Mnuchin said, \"This president [...] is going to have open communication with business leaders\", when asked about keeping jobs from being offshored to Mexico. During the interview, he also said he wants to \"strip back parts of Dodd\u2013Frank\" because he argued it was too complicated, and it prevented banks from lending. He called the stripping back of Dodd\u2013Frank \"the number-one priority on the regulatory side\".",
        "Secretary of the Treasury": "No information",
        "Nomination and confirmation": "On November 30, 2016, Donald Trump announced on his website that he would nominate Mnuchin as United States Secretary of the Treasury. In the statement, Trump called Mnuchin a \"world-class financier, banker, and businessman\", and he said Mnuchin played an important role in developing his \"plan to build a dynamic, booming economy\". Mnuchin himself said he was \"honored to have the opportunity to serve our great country in this important role\". He called Trump's economic agenda a \"bold\" one \"that creates good-paying jobs and defends the American worker\".On February 1, 2017, the Senate Finance Committee approved his nomination by a vote of 11\u20130 with all Democrats boycotting the vote, sending the nomination to the Senate floor.After the nomination was announced, Mnuchin resigned from his position on the board of trustees of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, to which he had donated between $100,000 and $250,000. When the pick was announced, Mnuchin was also a member of the boards of UCLA Health System, the NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital, and the Los Angeles Police Foundation.The New York Times noted that Mnuchin's selection \"fits uneasily with much of Mr. Trump's campaign attacks on the financial industry\". For example, an ad of Trump's campaign said Goldman Sachs' CEO had \"robbed [the] working class\". Mnuchin is the third former Goldman-Sachs executive to serve in the job, after Hank Paulson, under President George W. Bush, and Robert Rubin, under President Bill Clinton, in the 2000s and 1990s, respectively.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing on January 19, 2017, Mnuchin was criticized by Democrats for OneWest's foreclose practices. Mnuchin said: \"Since I was first nominated to serve as treasury secretary, I have been maligned as taking advantage of others' hardships in order to earn a buck. Nothing could be further from the truth\". During the hearing, it was also noted that Mnuchin had failed to disclose $95 million of real estate that he owned and his role as director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund in a tax haven. Mnuchin described the omissions as mistakes made amid a mountain of bureaucracy.Following Trump's January 2017 announcement about an investigation into voter registration, it was discovered that Mnuchin is registered to vote in both California and New York.On February 13, 2017, Mnuchin was confirmed as secretary of the treasury by a vote of 53\u201347. He received unanimous support from Senate Republicans but from only one Senate Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia.",
        "Tenure": "No information",
        "Artificial intelligence": "Mnuchin, when asked in an interview with Mike Allen of Axios \"whether he was worried about AI displacing jobs, replied: 'not at all ... I think we are so far away from that' \u2014 50 or 100 years \u2014 'it's not even on my radar screen'.\" Former treasury secretary Lawrence Summers was among critics of the statement, likening it to climate denial and creationism. Fortune columnist Alan Murray, noting the dispute, said he thought \"the core of the misunderstanding is the term 'artificial intelligence'\". While he felt Mnuchin expressed understanding of the role of technology in the labor market and also worried that the secretary and President Donald Trump were both in their ways underestimating technology's impact, he thought the climate-denial charge was excessive.",
        "Environment": "In January 2020, Mnuchin dismissed environmental activist Greta Thunberg, saying she should go to college and study economics before weighing in on policy. Others responded to Mnuchin, noting that thousands of economists with PhDs had signed a letter calling for taxation of carbon dioxide emissions.",
        "Federal budget and benefits": "On June 12, 2017, Mnuchin denied the debt ceiling not being raised before the August recess would cease federal government operations, and said Congress should weigh the option of \"changing the timing so that the debt ceiling matches the budget process so we don't have to deal with this in this format\" during a House appropriations subcommittee hearing. On June 14, during a prepared testimony ahead of the House subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs, Mnuchin said the budget proposal on the part of the Trump administration \"should send a message that the international financial institutions need to operate more efficiently\".On July 13, in response to limited lifespans being reported of Social Security and Medicaid, Mnuchin said: \"To help make these programs sustainable into the future, we should focus on strengthening the economy today. Compounding growth will help ease projected shortfalls.\"",
        "Taxes": "Mnuchin is a member of the so-called \"Big Six\", a group of politicians convened to write a tax reform proposal that incorporated input from members of the House of Representatives, Senate, and White House. In addition to Mnuchin, the group consists of senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY); representatives Kevin Brady (R-TX) and Paul Ryan (R-WI); and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.Shortly after the November 2016 election, Mnuchin, as the planned nominee for secretary of the treasury, stated in an interview with CNBC that \"any reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions so that there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class\", which Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) subsequently called \"The Mnuchin Rule\" during his Senate confirmation hearing.Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said a preliminary tax reform proposal by Trump in April 2017 \"allocates much of the tax relief to the wealthy\" and could increase the budget deficit. In a May 2017 event moderated by CNBC, Mnuchin stated the intent was to deliver a \"middle-income tax cut\", but that final results depended on the actions of Congress. Mnuchin appeared with White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short in a July 2017 event when they vowed to have the tax reform proposal before Congress after it resumed operations on September 5, and Mnuchin added that \"lowering the top [earners'] rate [would be offset by] elimination of huge deductions. So, for most people in the top rate, they're not going to get a tax cut.\" Mnuchin walked back the \"Mnuchin Rule\" in a September 2017 interview with CNN prior to the release of the proposed tax reforms, saying the \"no absolute tax cut for the upper class\" phrase \"was never a promise ... never a pledge ... it was what the president's objective was\". Under the tax reform proposal, the top tax rate would decline from 39.6 to 35 percent, and the budget deficit would likely increase.\n\nDuring an appearance at the Milken Institute Global Conference on May 1, 2017, Mnuchin said the White House and House Republicans were united in views on tax reductions: \"We're all on the same page. On 80% of the details, we're in agreement. Another 20%, we need to work through.\"During a conference in Ottawa on June 9, Mnuchin said government tax receipts were \"coming in somewhat lower\", but that this did not concern the administration.While appearing on ABC News on July 9, Mnuchin confirmed the administration was not considering a tax increase on the American upper class and the upcoming tax plan would finance itself.Mnuchin advocated for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a bill expected to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit. Mnuchin claimed the bill would pay for itself by causing explosive economic growth; he promised the treasury was working on an analysis that showed that, and that the analysis would be made public before Congress voted on the legislation. However, on November 30, 2017, sources within the Treasury department said Mnuchin had ordered no analysis of the tax plan and that there was no Treasury analysis that showed that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. In December 2017, the treasury released a one-page report on the tax plan which acknowledged that the plan would not pay for itself through economic growth.In May 2018, Mnuchin instructed his staff to accept a non-low-income tract in Storey County, Nevada, as an Opportunity Zone shortly after attending a Milken Institute event in Beverly Hills with Michael Milken. Milken was already an investor in the Nevada tract. In August 2018, Mnuchin attended a Milkin Institute conference on \"opportunity zones\" in the Hamptons with Milken and later accepted a flight to Los Angeles with Milken on his private jet. Treasury later issued a regulatory guidance that allows prior investors to benefit from newly designated \"opportunity zones\".",
        "International relations": "At a March 18, 2017, meeting of G-20 country finance ministers, Mnuchin supported the Trump administration's trade policy of economic protectionism.During an April 24, 2017, White House briefing, Mnuchin announced Department of Treasury sanctions against the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center. He said the sanctions were designed to create accountability for the Bashar al-Assad regime and its supporters in the wake of their violations both of U.N. Security Council resolutions and of the Chemical Weapons Convention.On June 29, Mnuchin announced the Bank of Dandong, a Chinese bank, had sanctions imposed on it by the U.S. He charged the bank with acting \"as a gateway for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems\".\n\nOn March 15, 2018, Mnuchin unveiled a series of sanctions, first time under CAATSA as well as Executive Order 13694, against various Russian entities and individuals.Beginning in November 2019, Mnuchin facilitated negotiations between the governments of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan with respect to the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam after tripartite negotiations between the three countries languished after eight years of talks. Egypt has opposed the dam, fearing that it will reduce the amount of water it receives from the Nile. In February 2020, Mnuchin stated that \"final testing and filling should not take place without an agreement.\" Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew said Mnuchin's advice to Ethiopia was \"ill-advised\".",
        "Support for President Trump": "While briefing reporters on April 26, Mnuchin said President Trump \"has no intention\" to release his tax returns, asserting that Trump \"has released plenty of information\".In the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, opposing the removal of Confederate statues, protesters included neo-Nazis and Klansmen, leading to violent conflicts. President Trump said there was \"blame on both sides\". Several hundred of Mnuchin's Yale classmates drafted a letter urging him to resign from the administration in protest. Mnuchin responded by saying: \"While I find it hard to believe I should have to defend myself on this, or the president, I feel compelled to let you know that the president in no way, shape, or form, believes that neo-Nazi and other hate groups who endorse violence are equivalent to groups that demonstrate in peaceful and lawful ways.\"On September 24, Mnuchin appeared on This Week and State of the Union to defend Trump's call to \"get that son of a bitch off the field right now\", referring to the protests by professional athletes starting in 2016, most notably marked by Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the pregame singing of the national anthem. Mnuchin said: \"... it's not about race, it's not about free speech. They can do free speech on their own time. ... [T]his is about respect for the military and first responders in the country.\"",
        "Comments on Lego Batman movie": "In March 2017, Mnuchin drew ethics concerns as regarding a statement he had made urging parents to \"send all your kids to LEGO Batman\" during an interview with Axios, apparently endorsing The Lego Batman Movie, of which he was an executive producer. Earlier in the interview, Mnuchin acknowledged: \"I'm not allowed to promote anything that I'm involved in.\" In response, Mnuchin wrote in a letter to Walter Shaub at the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) that he \"should not have made that statement\", and assured the OGE that \"it was not my intention to make a product endorsement\".",
        "Divestment from prior businesses": "In May 2017, it was reported that Mnuchin's fianc\u00e9e, Louise Linton, had succeeded him as the interim CEO of Dune Entertainment effective February 2017. Mnuchin had stepped down from the role as part of his ethics agreement to divest his business roles in preparation for his appointment as Secretary of the Treasury. Linton's announcement of her role at Dune Entertainment drew the attention of Senator Ron Wyden [D-Oregon], a member of the Senate Finance Committee, who questioned whether the appointment of Linton meant Mnuchin had fully divested from the company. Although the Department of the Treasury replied that she was serving in an uncompensated capacity, Linton resigned as interim CEO later in May.",
        "Use of government aircraft": "Following criticism of his use of a United States Air Force jet on a trip to Kentucky that involved viewing the solar eclipse, the Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) opened up an inquiry into Mnuchin's use of government aircraft. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request regarding Mnuchin's use of government aircraft. After the government failed to respond to the FOIA request, CREW sued the Department of the Treasury to release the documents. Mnuchin denied the trip was related to viewing the solar eclipse, saying: \"People in Kentucky took [the solar eclipse] very seriously. Being a New Yorker, I don't have any interest in watching the eclipse.\" Mnuchin, who was accompanied by his wife Louise Linton on the trip, reimbursed the government for Linton's travel to Kentucky, which amounted to $595 out of a total cost of $26,900.During the OIG's investigation into Mnuchin's use of government aircraft, it was revealed that Mnuchin had requested a military jet for his honeymoon travel to Europe in June 2017. Mnuchin stated that, as a member of the United States National Security Council, he needed access to secure communications during his honeymoon, but withdrew his request for the military jet after an alternative was identified. Mnuchin stated: \"I'm very sensitive to the use of government funds. I've never asked the government to pay for my personal travel ... The story [regarding the honeymoon travel request] was quite misreported.\" The OIG investigation also showed Mnuchin had taken a USAF C-37A, the military designation of the Gulfstream V, to return from New York to Washington on August 15 after flying to New York commercially. Although the request for travel on the military jet was initiated by Mnuchin's office, the aircraft had previously been used to fly Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao from Joint Base Andrews to Teterboro Airport. Mnuchin's return flight lasted less than an hour and had an operating cost of at least $25,000.The OIG released its report on October 4, 2017, concluding that there was \"no violation of law in these requests and uses\" of government aircraft by Mnuchin, but also expressing concern regarding \"a disconnect between the standard of proof called for in the Daley memo and the actual amount of proof provided by Treasury and accepted by the White House in justifying these trip requests\". The referenced Daley Memo was issued by then-White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley on April 4, 2011, and it stated the standards for use of government aircraft by senior executive branch officials were given in OMB Circular A-126, dated February 10, 1993. The Daley Memo also states that travel using military aircraft must be considered a White House Support Mission, taken at the specific direction of the President under one of a set of limited circumstances that \"make commercial transportation unacceptable\". The typical reimbursement paid by requesting federal executive agencies covers only the cost of an equivalent coach ticket on a commercial flight.In the report, the OIG reviewed nine travel requests by Mnuchin for military air transportation since March 2017, of which seven were approved and taken, one was withdrawn, and one was approved with travel pending in late October 2017. The total cost of the seven trips taken was $811,800, calculated from per-hour cost and operating hours for the specific aircraft, or Air Force-provided direct costs of operations. Two of the flights, taken to Europe in March and May 2017, each cost more than $300,000. On one flight, to Ottawa in June, Mnuchin was accompanied by his then-fianc\u00e9e Linton. The total cost of the Ottawa trip was $16,350, and the reimbursement repaid for Linton's cost of travel was $744. Due to an inconsistency in the records provided for the trip to New York on August 15, the OIG opened a second inquiry in October 2017, \"to assure that [the OIG] have in fact received all relevant records\".",
        "Student heckling incident": "Mnuchin spoke at UCLA on February 26, 2018, where he was heckled and initially blocked the video from being released.The university said in a statement that Mnuchin, who at first \"subsequently withdrew\" his approval for the video to be posted online, later gave consent for the video to be published.",
        "Personal life": "Mnuchin's mother was a long-time investor with Bernie Madoff. After his mother died in early 2005, Mnuchin and his brother liquidated her investments, making $3.2 million. A Madoff trustee sued to retrieve the money from the Mnuchins, but a court ruled that the Madoff trust could recoup money only from those who had cashed out less than two years before the December 2008 collapse of Madoff's company.",
        "Marriages": "From 1992 to 1999, Mnuchin was married to Kathryn Leigh McCarver.In 1999, Mnuchin married Heather deForest Crosby, and they had three children together. Heather Mnuchin was active in philanthropy and AZIAM yoga. After he bought IndyMac, Mnuchin moved to a 21,000-square-foot (2,000 m2), $26.5 million house in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, because the company's headquarters was in Pasadena. They divorced in 2014.\nMnuchin married actress Louise Linton on June 24, 2017. Vice President Mike Pence presided over the ceremony.",
        "Non-profit work": "Mnuchin served as a member of the development board of Yale University, as a board member of the Riverdale Country School, as a member of the national board and senior member of the non-profit youth organization Junior Achievement, to which he had donated money, and as a board member of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.",

    "Mario Monti": {
        "Introduction": "Mario Monti,  (born 19 March 1943) is an Italian economist and academic who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 2011 to 2013, leading a technocratic government in the wake of the Italian debt crisis.\nMonti served as a European Commissioner from 1995 to 2004, with responsibility for the Internal Market, Services, Customs and Taxation from 1995 to 1999 and for Competition from 1999 to 2004. Monti has also been rector and president of Bocconi University in Milan for many years.\nOn 12 November 2011, in the midst of the European sovereign debt crisis, Monti was invited by President Giorgio Napolitano to form a new technocratic government following the resignation of Silvio Berlusconi. Monti was sworn in as Prime Minister on 16 November 2011, just a week after having been appointed a Lifetime Senator by President Napolitano, and initially became Minister of Economy and Finances as well, giving that portfolio up the following July.\nFrom 16 May 2013 to 17 October 2013, Monti was the president of Civic Choice, a centrist political party in Italy.",
        "Early life": "Mario Monti was born in Varese on 19 March 1943. His mother was from Piacenza. Although his father grew up in Varese, he was born in Luj\u00e1n in the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, where his grandfather Abramo had emigrated to from Italy in the 19th century and built up a soft-drink and beer-production business. Monti's father went back to Argentina during World War II, but later returned to his family home in Varese.Monti studied at the private Leo XIII High School and attended Bocconi University of Milan, where he obtained a degree in economics in 1965. Later, he won a scholarship to Yale University where he studied under James Tobin, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics.",
        "Academic career": "Monti began his academic career at the University of Trento, before moving to teach economics at the University of Turin from 1970 to 1985, and finally to Bocconi University, where he was appointed Rector in 1989, and President in 1994. He also served as President of the SUERF (The European Money and Finance Forum) from 1982 to 1985. His research helped to create the \"Klein-Monti model\", aimed at describing the behaviour of banks operating under monopoly circumstances.",
        "European Commissioner": "No information",
        "Santer Commission": "In 1994, Monti was appointed to the Santer Commission, along with Emma Bonino, by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. In his office as a European Commissioner from 1994 to 1999, he was responsible for internal market, financial services and financial integration, customs, and taxation. His work with the Commission earned him the nickname \"Super Mario\" from his colleagues and from the press.",
        "Prodi Commission": "In 1999, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema confirmed Monti's appointment to the new Prodi Commission and he was given one of the most powerful positions at the Commission, with responsibility for Competition.As Competition Commissioner, Monti led the investigation into a number of high-profile and controversial mergers, including: Scania AB & Volvo (1999), WorldCom & Sprint (2000), General Electric & Honeywell (2001), Schneider Electric & Legrand (2001) and Carnival Corporation & P&O Ferries (2002). His term in office also saw the European Court of Justice, for the first time, overrule the Commission's decision to block a merger in three separate cases, although two were decided by his predecessor. Monti was also responsible for levying the EU's largest ever fine at the time (\u20ac497 million) against Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position in 2004.\n\nMonti was criticised in the media and by competition lawyers for the perceived inflexibility of the merger oversight process and the high number of cases that were being blocked. On 1 November 2002, Monti responding to the European Court of Justice's ruling which reversed his decision to block the merger between Airtours & First Choice Holidays said, \"Last week was a tough week for the Commission's merger control policy and of course for me.\" This ruling in combination with his decision to block the General Electric & Honeywell merger led to criticism in the United States against both the Commission's procedures and accusations that Monti's decisions were politically motivated. Monti, however, was defended by supporters who saw his actions as an important step in the development of competition law in the EU. Dan Rubinfeld, economics professor at the University of California who worked on the US Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft, said of Monti, \"There has been a lot of talk of politics in this and other cases, but I believe he has been driven entirely by the desire to do the right thing.\"On 11 December 2002, Monti proposed a series of reforms to the EU's merger rules and made structural changes within the Commission's Competition department which aimed to improve transparency for companies throughout the merger review process. The reforms were adopted by the EU as Regulation 139/2004 (known as ECMR).\nIn 2004, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi returned to power in Italy and chose not to re-appoint Monti to the Commission when his second term ended.",
        "Barroso Commission": "In 2010, Monti was asked by Commission President Manuel Barroso to draft a \"Report on the Future of the Single Market\" proposing further measures towards the completion of the EU's Single Market. The published report, adopted by the EU on 13 April 2011, proposed 12 reforms to the Single Market and was intended to \"give new momentum\" to the European economy.",
        "Prime Minister of Italy": "No information",
        "Appointment": "On 9 November 2011, Monti was appointed a lifetime senator by Italian President Giorgio Napolitano. He was seen as a favourite to replace Silvio Berlusconi to lead a new unity government in Italy in order to implement reforms and austerity measures. On 12 November 2011, following Berlusconi's resignation, Napolitano invited Monti to form a new government. Monti accepted the offer, and held talks with the leaders of the main Italian political parties, declaring that he wanted to form a government that would remain in office until the next scheduled general elections in 2013. On 16 November 2011, Monti was sworn in as Prime Minister of Italy, after unveiling a technocratic cabinet composed entirely of unelected professionals. He also chose to hold the post of Minister of Economy and Finances. On 17 and 18 November 2011, the Italian Senate and Italian Chamber of Deputies both passed motions of confidence supporting Monti's government, with only Lega Nord voting against.",
        "Austerity measures": "On 4 December 2011, Monti's government introduced emergency austerity measures intended to stem the worsening economic conditions in Italy and restore market confidence, especially after rising Italian government bond yields began to threaten Italy's financial stability. The austerity package called for increased taxes, pension reform and measures to fight tax evasion. Monti also announced that he would be giving up his own salary as part of the reforms. On 16 December 2011, the Lower House of the Italian Parliament adopted the measures by a vote of 495 to 88. Six days later the Upper House gave final approval to the package by a vote of 257 to 41.",
        "Labour market reforms": "On 20 January 2012, Monti's government formally adopted a package of reforms targeting Italy's labour market. The reforms are intended to open certain professions (such as taxi drivers, pharmacists, doctors, lawyers and notaries) to more competition by reforming their licensing systems and abolishing minimum tariffs for their services. Article 18 of Italy's labour code, which requires companies that employ 15 or more workers to re-hire (rather than compensate) any employee found to have been fired without just cause, would also be reformed. The reforms to Article 18 are intended to make it easier for companies to dismiss or lay-off employees, which would hopefully encourage companies to hire more employees on permanent rather than short-term renewable contracts. The proposals have been met by strong opposition from labour unions and public protests. In early January 2012, consultations between the government and labour unions commenced and on 13 February it was reported in the Italian media that a compromise on the proposals was very close and the government was hopeful that reforms could be approved by the Italian parliament in March.",

        "Dead Aid": "Moyo's first book, Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There is Another Way for Africa (2009), became a New York Times bestseller. It argues that government-to-government foreign aid has harmed Africa and should be phased out. In the book she states that in the past 50 years, more than $1 trillion in development-related aid has been transferred from rich countries to Africa, and questions whether anything has changed.The book suggests that official development assistance (ODA), as opposed to humanitarian aid, perpetuates the cycle of poverty and hinders economic growth in Africa. It offers developing countries proposals for financial development instead of relying on foreign government-to-government aid.The Financial Times summarized the book's argument, stating \"Limitless development assistance to African governments, [Moyo] argues, has fostered dependency, encouraged corruption and ultimately perpetuated poor governance and poverty.\"",

The Guardian stated, \"How the West Was Lost is more interesting, wider in scale and more important than Dead Aid' It went on to state \"Moyo is a very orthodox thinker, unable to consider a world beyond free markets and underpriced resources and blind to the social effects of what she proposes and celebrates\".\"\nSimilarly, Alan Beattie of the Financial Times wrote, \"The challenges it identifies are for the most part real, if not original. But the huge flaws of the emerging economies are ignored.\" The Economist said \"these arguments need much better supporting material than the book provides\".",
        "Winner Take All": "Moyo's third book, Winner Take All: China's Race for Resources and What It Means for the World (2012), examines global commodity dynamics over the next several decades, specifically China's massive global rush for natural resources including hard commodities (metals and minerals) and soft commodities (timber and food). It predicts the financial and geopolitical implications of a world of diminishing resources, and argues that China is already well on the way to gaining the upper hand in world economic dominance.Winner Take All became a New York Times bestseller. A review in the Financial Times stated that \"If Dambisa Moyo is right, the demands of the world's most populous state are bad news for the rest of us. ... One cannot accuse Moyo of failing to do her homework.\" The Telegraph commented \"Moyo thinks [China's impact on the global commodity market] will go on and on, powered by an unstoppable Chinese economy. Perhaps she is right, but the grounds for doubting whether the future will be a straight line from the past deserve a hearing.\"",

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the United States ambassador to Germany from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama.Murphy had a 23-year career at Goldman Sachs, where he held several high-level positions and accumulated considerable wealth before retiring in 2006. He is involved in many civic organizations and philanthropic pursuits. He served as finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee in the mid-late 2000s under Howard Dean. In the Obama administration, Murphy served as the United States ambassador to Germany from 2009 to 2013, during which time he dealt with the international fallout from the United States diplomatic cables leak.\nWhile planning to run for governor, Murphy and his wife Tammy Murphy launched New Start New Jersey, a progressive organization active from November 2014 to December 2017, intended to increase his political visibility in the state. He defeated then-Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno in the 2017 gubernatorial election.

He was reelected in 2021, defeating Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli with 51% of the vote and becoming the first Democratic governor of New Jersey to win a second term since 1977. In July 2022, Murphy became the first National Governors Association chair from New Jersey.",
        "Early life and education": "Murphy was born in Needham, Massachusetts, and was raised in both Needham and nearby Newton, the son of Dorothy Louise (Dunton) and Walter F. Murphy.The family was Irish American, with Phil being third generation. According to Murphy, his household was \"middle class on a good day;\" by his recollection, his mother, a secretary, and father, a high-school dropout who took any job he could (including liquor store manager and for-pay pallbearer), lived paycheck to paycheck.Both of his parents were enthusiastic supporters of John F. Kennedy and volunteered for his campaign in the 1952 United States Senate election in Massachusetts. Murphy played soccer as a boy, an interest that stayed with him in later life. His mother believed strongly in the importance of education, and Phil and his three older siblings all earned college degrees.Murphy graduated from Needham High School, along with Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, in 1975. He graduated from Harvard University in 1979 with an AB degree in economics. At Harvard he aspired to become a professional musical theater performer and was elected president of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, a theatrical student society. He then attended the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, where he received a MBA in 1983.",
        "Career": "No information",
        "Personal wealth": "Murphy's position at Goldman Sachs when the firm had its IPO brought his net worth above $50 million. By one estimate, reported in Der Spiegel in 2009, his wealth after leaving the firm was in the range of several hundred million dollars.Murphy moved to Middletown Township, New Jersey, in the late 1990s. He and his family live in a riverside estate with a six-figure annual property tax bill. Murphy also owns homes in Germany and Italy.In 2016 Murphy released five years' worth of federal tax returns. In 2014 he earned about $6 million, paid about $2 million in taxes for an effective tax rate of 34%, and directly or indirectly donated 24% of his income to charity. The returns for the other years showed effective tax rates ranging between 32% and 39%. Murphy's charitable donations during these five years averaged about $980,000 a year. Due to his wealth and the complicated nature of his holdings, his federal tax filings have been known to exceed 300 pages in length.",
        "Finance career": "No information",
        "Goldman Sachs": "Murphy began his career with a summer associate internship at Goldman Sachs in 1982. He was hired after graduating in 1983. He rose in the ranks quickly, later attributing that success to his ability to make deals: \"Two people may not like each other and can't work together. Their mutual dislike is their problem. I don't let it become mine. I'll be the man in the middle and the three of us can work out something everybody is happy with.\"From 1993 to 1997 Murphy headed the firm's Frankfurt office. His business responsibilities were later expanded to encompass Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as in the emerging post-Warsaw Pact economies of Central Europe. In this role he engaged in a number of transactions with the German government's Treuhandanstalt agency, whose purpose was to conduct the privatization of formerly state-owned enterprises within the boundaries of no-longer-extant East Germany. Murphy was also active in the Atlantik-Br\u00fccke organization, including co-founding its International Advisor Council.From 1997 to 1999 Murphy served as the President of Goldman Sachs (Asia). In that capacity, he was officed in Hong Kong. During this time Goldman Sachs profited from its investment in Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, a shoe manufacturer that became notorious for its harsh labor practices. The $55 million investment was made the year before Murphy took the Asia post and it is unclear to what extent Murphy was aware of the firm's operational characteristics. In 1998 Murphy told the Wall Street Journal that \"We [at Goldman Sachs] are elite in the sense the Marine Corps is elite\".In 1999 Murphy secured a spot on the firm's Management Committee. There his colleagues included Hank Paulson and Gary Cohn, both of whom later served at highest levels of the federal government. This coincided with the repeal of Glass\u2013Steagall; the repeal allowed Murphy and his colleagues to make much greater use of leverage and profoundly changed how the company generated profits.In 2001 Murphy became global co-head of the firm's Investment Management Division. This unit oversaw the investments of foundations, pensions, hedge funds, and wealthy personages, and by 2003 had amassed $373 billion in holdings. Hedge funds, in particular, received large lines of credit from Murphy's unit. Another company initiative that Murphy helped to undertake was the unit that did major business in the emerging markets within the EMEA region.In 2003 Murphy's day-to-day responsibilities at the firm ended, and he became a Senior Director of the firm. He retired in 2005\u201306. Murphy spent 23 years at Goldman Sachs in all.",
        "Democratic Party finance chair": "After leaving Goldman Sachs, Murphy served from 2006 to 2009 as the National Finance Chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), where he worked with DNC Chair Howard Dean. Murphy liked both Dean's vision for the party and the discipline Dean brought to the task, and the two became close friends.It was Murphy who financed Dean's \"50-state strategy\". The strategy was opposed by powerful Democrats in Congress such as Charles Schumer and Rahm Emanuel, but Murphy refused to visibly engage in this dispute, saying, \"I'm a sucker for the view that you have it out in the locker room, not in public.\"  Former Goldman Sachs colleague and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin said of Murphy's ability to handle the new position, \"He has very substantial technical expertise from his corporate finance work, but he combines that with a wonderful facility for dealing with people.\" Dean later said that Murphy well learned the lesson not all such figures of commerce understand: that while in business you can command people to do things, in politics things are never so simple.During his first year, Murphy focused on gaining donations from his contacts from his university years and Goldman Sachs; within that year he was able to substantially reduce the DNC's gap with the Republican National Committee. In all, Murphy says he raised $300 million for the DNC.Murphy was also a big donor to Democratic candidates, giving them almost $1.5 million by 2009. This included modest contributions to individual candidates and several six-figure sums to party committees. During the hotly contested 2008 Democratic presidential primaries he was a superdelegate but remained uncommitted for most of the contest.",
        "Civic activities": "Murphy has been appointed to the boards or committees of various civic or philanthropic groups. Among these are the NAACP, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, the Center for American Progress, 180 Turning Lives Around, and several programs of the University of Pennsylvania such as the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business and the Wharton School Graduate Executive and Asian Program. Other such entities include the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the Investment Company Institute, and Prosperity New Jersey. He has served as the grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Rumson, New Jersey, several times.Murphy has helped lead local charities to support troubled teens and domestic abuse survivors. He and his wife founded 2nd Floor, a teen helpline in New Jersey that had fielded 700,000 calls by 2015 and that has helped save lives.In 2004-05 Murphy co-chaired a national task force on 21st-century public education for the Center for American Progress that featured fellow co-chairs Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano and academic and civil rights figure Roger Wilkins.\nThe Renewing Our Schools, Securing Our Future task force issued a report called \"Getting Smarter, Becoming Fairer: A Progressive Education Agenda For A Stronger Nation\". It called for a longer school day, a reorganized school year, and extending learning scenarios to the pre-kindergarten and post-high school domains.The Murphy family's time in Germany made them all soccer enthusiasts. Murphy has served on the boards of the U.S. Soccer Foundation and the U.S. Soccer Federation World Cup Bid Committee for 2018 and 2022. He owns a stake in the professional New Jersey women's soccer club NJ/NY Gotham FC; he has said that he knows the club is a money-losing venture but that he wanted to show his soccer-playing daughter that women's professional soccer can exist in the United States.",
        "New Jersey Benefits Task Force chair": "In May 2005 Acting Governor Richard Codey named Murphy to chair the New Jersey Benefits Task Force on public sector employee benefits in response to the New Jersey pension crisis, a particularly long-running instance of the state-level pensions crises taking place nationwide.The task force reported its findings in December 2005. By this time Murphy was already considered to be retired from Goldman Sachs. The report decried past state practices, saying that \"gimmicks\" had been constructed instead of genuine solutions.As chair, Murphy recommended the sale of publicly owned assets. For the most part that did not happen, but some of his other suggestions, such as raising the age of retirement and recalculating how pensions related to salary earned, were taken. Labor unions opposed the recommendations, with leader Carla Katz saying, \"We will fight vigorously and loudly against any cuts to our pensions or health benefits proposed by the task force.\" The New York Times wrote that \"no matter what happens, the report's legacy may well be that it tried to tackle the issues head-on.\"",
        "U.S. Ambassador to Germany": "Murphy served as United States Ambassador to Germany under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2013. The possibility of his being named to the post was first reported by Spiegel Online International in May 2009. The former U.S. Ambassador John Kornblum supported the choice, saying, \"Murphy has been involved in German-American relations for many years. He's a good choice.\" An agr\u00e9ment was issued, and Obama formally nominated him to the position on July 9. Murphy was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 7, and appeared with his family in Berlin on August 21. That they arrived in an expensive Gulfstream V executive jet irked Chancellor Merkel, who saw it as evidence of the long practice of presidents awarding wealthy donors with ambassadorships. Murphy presented his credentials in Berlin to German President Horst Koehler on September 3, which the State Department considers his effective start date. He was sworn into the position on September 13.During his tenure, Murphy promoted American trade and focused on engaging Germany's youth through town hall meetings, exchange programs, and social media communication. He said, \"The legacy of our time together in Germany will be measured by how well we 'set the table' for tomorrow, by how deeply today's youth understand the ongoing relevance of the transatlantic bridge. They are tomorrow's leaders and our investment in their future is our highest priority.\" In doing so he paid particular attention to children who had immigrated to Germany, who rarely had the opportunity to meet Americans.The United States diplomatic cables leak, published by WikiLeaks in 2010, contained negative statements Murphy signed about senior German politicians, including a remark by Murphy that Merkel was \"insecure\" and unfavorable comments by embassy staff about Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister. Some German officials expressed desire that Murphy be recalled. In response, Murphy appeared on German television outlets such as ZDF in an attempt at damage control. In Spiegel Online, he said, \"I'm a big boy. At the end of the day, the buck stops with me,\" and that he would not \"apologize for one speck\" of what his staff had done. On December 5, he apologized for the leak in Welt am Sonntag. Murphy later said that the episode was \"incredibly awkward and embarrassing\" but that the two countries worked through it, and that in the end Germany-United States relations were stronger than ever.\n\nRegarding the European debt crisis, Murphy said in 2013, \"The big debate in Europe, which I think is a false debate, is either fiscal consolidation or growth. And the reality is that Europe needs both: it needs fiscal consolidation and growth.\" Regarding economic differences between the nations, he said, \"Germany believes strongly that the first order of business is to cut your debts and deficits and from that, good things will come. We're more likely to say a little bit of stimulus will jump-start things, even if it means incurring more debt. But you work your way through those issues.\"On May 29, 2013, it was announced that Murphy was stepping down from the post. He was still ambassador as of July 3; he returned to the United States at some point during July and formally stayed in the role until his mission terminated on August 26.",
        "Entry into New Jersey politics": "Murphy was mentioned as a potential candidate in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election, but did not run. Rather, upon returning to the United States he returned to Murphy Endeavors LLC, a business management consultancy firm, of which he was the principal, with offices in Red Bank, New Jersey. He started the firm in 2009 after leaving the DNC position, but it was soon put on hold due to his ambassadorial nomination. He also gave speeches about his experiences in Germany, especially in connection with the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.",
        "New Start New Jersey": "In 2014 Murphy created New Start New Jersey, a nonprofit progressive policy think tank that held a number of events around New Jersey. His wife was co-founder, chair, and secretary. The organization said it would neither endorse nor fund political candidates, as it was barred from doing so, but it did serve to raise Murphy's political visibility. Its events included an appearance by singer Jon Bon Jovi. One of its goals was to help displaced workers back into the work force. (Making reference to visibility, in 2016 hacked Podesta emails revealed that Murphy was already seriously considering a run for governor when the organization was founded, telling Podesta that his ambitions were \"very serious but not yet committed\" and that the new entity would improve his name recognition.)",
        "New Way for New Jersey": "In September 2015 Murphy launched a progressive organization named New Way for New Jersey, which held a number of town halls, including some by telephone on Sunday evenings, and encouraged Democrats to sign petitions critical of incumbent Governor Chris Christie. Unlike New Start New Jersey, New Way for New Jersey was an explicitly political organization.",
        "Criticism of Chris Christie": "On March 2, 2016, Murphy's organization New Way for New Jersey launched a petition that criticized Christie for neglecting his duties as governor due to his travel and support of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The group implored Christie to \"do your job or quit\". Murphy supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary and fundraised for her.After Murphy announced his candidacy for governor, New Way for New Jersey folded. New Start New Jersey continued, albeit without Murphy on its board.",
        "Campaigns for governor": "No information",
        "2017": "In May 2016 Murphy announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 2017 New Jersey gubernatorial election. He became the race's first announced candidate. He said of his rationale, \"I am running for governor because New Jersey desperately needs adult leadership that puts our people first.\"Announcing so early was unusual. Comparisons with unpopular former governor Jon Corzine, another wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive, were a challenge Murphy had to meet. Murphy also began the campaign with little name recognition. He initially planned to lend $10 million to the campaign but to also aggressively fund-raise. He said he would accept no so-called dark money and that \"I'm holding our campaign to a higher standard.\"",
        "Democratic primary": "Murphy was the first declared Democratic candidate for governor, although several other candidates were expected to run. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, Assemblyman John Wisniewski of Sayreville, State Senator Raymond Lesniak, and State Senate President Stephen M. Sweeney of Gloucester County were often mentioned in news media along with other candidates. Fulop and Sweeney were geographic rivals, and in terms of state party organizational support, Max Pizarro of the New York Observer characterized Murphy as \"everyone's number two choice. If Fulop or Sweeney stumbles, Murphy could rocket from zero to 100 overnight.\"On September 28, 2016, Fulop announced he would not run for governor and endorsed Murphy. On October 6, Sweeney announced he too would not run, citing apparent party support for Murphy, whom he endorsed. The move came as Murphy was corralling dozens of endorsements, including all of those from North Jersey county party committees and the most populous Central Jersey county committees.As a result of these withdrawals Murphy became the clear front-runner for the nomination, but Wisniewski and Lesniak, the two best-known remaining potential candidates, both said they still intended to run.After the unexpected result of the 2016 United States presidential election, Murphy noted that the fortunes of the state Democratic Party had improved in the election, saying, \"As with so many, I am disappointed by the [presidential] results from Tuesday. But I refuse to be discouraged. And I won't be dissuaded from working to make New Jersey a fairer, more just place for all of us.\" Murphy subsequently drew criticism from the New Jersey Lieutenant Governor and Republican candidate for governor, Kim Guadagno, for seeming to draw a comparison between the Trump campaign and the early years of the Nazi rise to power in Germany.On November 15, Wisniewski, who gained visibility as a leader of the Fort Lee lane closure scandal investigations, announced his run for governor. In his message he implicitly criticized Murphy, saying \"I'm not a Wall Street executive. I haven't made hundreds of millions of dollars by outsourcing jobs. I've learned the value of public service...\"In January 2017 Murphy was endorsed by New Jersey's two U.S. senators, Bob Menendez and Cory Booker. He also had the endorsements of all 21 county party organizations. In statewide races, these designations offer favorable ballot position, which some voters pick by default, and are often central to success.By February 2017 Murphy was leading by a solid margin in a Quinnipiac Poll both for the Democratic nomination and in a putative general election matchup against Guadagno. Another poll was less certain, showing most voters undecided.Two debates with his main Democratic rivals, including former U.S. Treasury official Jim Johnson along with Wiesiewski and Lesniak, were held within a short span of time in May; during the second Murphy found himself under sustained attack by his rivals, but defended himself by staking out very progressive positions. Politico wrote, \"Underdogs Jim Johnson, Ray Lesniak and John Wisniewski savaged the front-runner, Phil Murphy, accusing him during the 90-minute televised contest of buying off party bosses and being disingenuous on environmental issues.\" Subsequent campaigning by those three continued to emphasize that Murphy was \"buying\" the election. Nonetheless, polls continued to show Murphy with a sizable lead over all rivals.With $19 million raised, of which $15 million was his own money, Murphy continued to spend the most of all the candidates; his spending was more than twice that of all the other Democratic and Republican candidates for governor combined. He also donated $1.5 million to the various county party organizations as well as to some candidates for local offices. Murphy captured the endorsement of the first major national figure to inject himself into the race, former Vice President Joe Biden. Additionally, he was endorsed by former Vice President Al Gore, which helped solidify Murphy's environmentalist credentials after some attacks on his role as a financier investing in fracking operations. He also had the fundraising support of wealthy entertainment figures Jon Bon Jovi and Whoopi Goldberg. Most, though not all, of the key labor unions in the state, also supported Murphy. Nevertheless, there was still a sense of apathy about the election on the part of the state's voters; as the New York Times stated shortly before the primary vote, \"a majority of voters still say they 'don't know' who to vote for and are not doing much to find out.\"Murphy won the June 6 primary decisively, with 48% of the vote. Johnson and Wisniewski finished second and third with 22% apiece, Lesniak got 5%, and scattered others less.",
        "General election": "Murphy faced Guadagno, the Republican nominee, in the November general election. In that campaign Guadagno ran as a moderate, attempting to avoid association with both Christie, who held a record-low approval rating for a governor, and Donald Trump. Instead she sought to focus on Murphy's Goldman Sachs background.On July 26 Murphy announced Assemblywoman and Speaker Emerita Sheila Oliver as his running mate.",
        "Policy proposals": "State bank: Murphy's campaign has suggested a North Dakota-style statewide investment bank as a way of boosting New Jersey's economy. The bank would supply loans to not just businesses but also college students. Moreover, it would have the effect of eliminating Wall Street firms \u2013 including his own former one \u2013 from participating in state financial activities.\nPensions: regarding the state's still-troubled pension system, Murphy has said that there are no easy answers but that \"the state has to stand up for its side of the bargain. Period. If the state doesn't, there is no use having the second-paragraph discussion.\"\nMarijuana: Murphy favors the legalization of recreational marijuana in New Jersey.\nMinimum wage: In terms of employment under the law, Murphy supports the notion of a $15 minimum wage. He also favors guaranteed paid sick leave in New Jersey.\nAffordable housing/builder's remedy debate: In summer 2017, amid heavy local outcry over overdevelopment of apartment complexes and concerns about wealthy developers exploiting the Mount Laurel doctrine to overbuild small towns, Murphy proposed a solution that would not require more forced building. \"With smart investments, we can create thousands of units of much-needed affordable housing without building a single new building,\" he said.\nSchool desegregation. In 2018, members of Murphy's transition team filed a school desegregation lawsuit, Latino Action Network v. New Jersey.",

In March, he signed legislation which automatically registers all those who apply for a driver's license or state ID to vote. In April 2018, a poll found that Murphy was popular with the majority of New Jersey residents, with 44% approving and 28% disapproving of his performance as governor; another 28% stated they did not have an opinion on Murphy. By June, Murphy had signed legislation to permit sports betting in the state. In December, Murphy signed into law new legislation which would overhaul the way NJ Transit managed.",
        "2019": "In February 2019, a Monmouth University survey found that Murphy's approval rating had slumped to 43%, with his disapproval rating rising up to 40%.

In May, Murphy signed legislation which expanded the time period during which alleged sexual assault victims could sue their alleged attackers. A Monmouth University survey conducted in September found that 41% of New Jersey residents approved of Murphy verses 38% who disapproved. Another survey conducted showed that 31% stated that Murphy's polices have hurt the middle-class in the state, while only 17% said that they have benefited. Murphy had opposed construction of a new power plant in New Jersey Meadowlands in North Bergen, stating this in October.",
        "2020": "Murphy's governorship in 2020 was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first case in the state was reported on March 5, and Murphy declared a state of emergency on March 9. He signed multiple executive orders in late March which ordered a lockdown of the whole state. By April, most schools and businesses had completely shut down, with students being required to learn from home. By the summer, Murphy had reopened most restaurants but imposed extensive mask mandates. By July, COVID-related deaths in the state neared 16,000 and over 100,000 residents had tested positive. A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll conducted in July found that Murphy's approval rating had increased to 67%, with his handling of the pandemic being credited for his strong performance.In the 2020 United States presidential election, Murphy initially endorsed New Jersey senator Cory Booker for the Democratic nomination after Booker announced his candidacy in January 2019. After Booker dropped out of the race in January 2020, Murphy announced he did not intend on endorsing any of the other candidates still in the race.

He continues to publish research regarding the global economy, in addition to coming up with innovative investment strategies for clients. His new appointment was regarded as a symbol of Goldman's \"efforts to reposition itself for Wall Street's post-crisis era\", one in which Goldman Sachs is \"bullish\" about the fact that emerging markets are \"the future\".

        "Foreign exchange markets": "O'Neill has been called a \"currency guru\"; he has been hailed as \"the top foreign-exchange economist anywhere in the world in the past decade\".

He was later named to the position of co-president of Goldman's Singapore office.In 2006, Ong was promoted to the position of co-head of Asia investment banking, replacing Bill Wicker, who moved to New York. GS moved Ong from Singapore to Beijing with the intention that he would also become CEO of their Beijing joint venture Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities, Co. However, Ong's weak knowledge of written Chinese led him to fail a language ability examination required to take up his new position. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had required since 2004 that CEOs, deputy CEOs, and heads of supervisory boards at locally incorporated securities firms all pass the examination; however many CEOs and deputy CEOs of other securities companies were not able to pass the CSRC examination as well, but were given waivers. Goldman elevated the joint venture's deputy CEO Zha Xiangyang to the CEO post in Ong's place.One industry observer criticised the decision by CSRC to deny Ong his new position as \"short sighted and xenophobic\", also noting that it served as a wake-up call to overseas Chinese that shared ethnicity was not a guarantee of success in the mainland China market. A China Economic Review editorial speculated that the language proficiency issue was merely a pretext, and that the true reason that CSRC denied Goldman permission to name Ong to his new position was due to his family ties to Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings and his own role in the money-losing sale of former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's Shin Corporation to Temasek.",
        "Hopu Fund": "In January 2008, Ong resigned from his position at GS, ending a fifteen-year tenure there; his departure was seen as a major blow to the firm. He stated that he planned to return to Malaysia to spend time with his family and work in his family business. It soon emerged that he would be joining fellow former GS executive Fang Fenglei at the Hopu Fund, a new China private equity fund established by Fang. Goldman planned to invest roughly US$300 million of their own money in the new fund, while Temasek would provide another US$1 billion. The total size of the fund was planned at US$2 billion; interest from potential investors far exceeded that amount, according to unnamed sources. In 2010 the fund began winding down when it announced that Hopu Investment Management would not be raising a second fund.",

        "Introduction": "Ilario Gregory Pantano (born August 28, 1971) is a former United States Marine Corps second lieutenant. He has also been an author, a television commentator, and served as a Deputy Sheriff in Wilmington, North Carolina. He was a Republican Party nominee for the US House of Representatives in 2010.\nPantano served in the Persian Gulf War, during Operation Desert Storm, and in the Iraq War, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He came to national attention when he was accused of premeditated murder in the killing of two Iraqi captives, during a unit mission near Fallujah, Iraq on April 15, 2004. An article 32 hearing found no credible evidence or testimony for the accusation and declined to prosecute Pantano, dropping all charges. Claiming terrorist threats against his family, he resigned his officer's commission and was honorably discharged. These events and his other experiences as a combat Marine during the Persian Gulf War and in Iraq in 2004 are the subject of his memoir, Warlord: No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy.",
        "Early life, education and business career": "Pantano was born in New York City and grew up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. His father, Benito, was an Italian immigrant, and his mother, Merry, a literary agent, is a native of Salina, Kansas. He attended the private Horace Mann High School in New York City on scholarship. Following graduation he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served active duty in the first Gulf War.\nFollowing his return to civilian life, Pantano earned an economics degree from New York University. He worked as an energy trader for Goldman Sachs. From 1995 to 1998, he was a member of the start-up team that integrated top-tier investment bank culture (GS) with utility business (BG&E) in Constellation Power, an electricity trading joint venture that was acquired for $11 billion by FPL. Shortly thereafter, he became a movie producer with the New York-based firm The Shooting Gallery, and co-founded Filter Media, a company specializing in interactive television. Pantano married Jill Chapman, a fashion model and entrepreneur who had appeared in Vogue Italia. The couple live in North Carolina and have two sons.",
        "Military service and controversy": "No information",
        "First enlistment": "Pantano served in the U. S. Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War as a TOW gunner. Pantano completed Scout Sniper training, and was promoted to Sergeant, remaining in the Marine Corps until 1993.",
        "Rejoins the USMC": "Immediately following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Pantano decided to rejoin the Marines. Pantano's apartment was next to a fire station where eleven firemen, four of whom were former Marines, perished in the attacks. He was accepted to Officer Candidate School and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant upon completion.\nHe was a popular officer and his superiors described him as the best platoon commander in his battalion. His men reported that they appreciated the extra training drills he put them through. As Time Magazine reported in 2005, \"Pantano prepared his platoon by working the men hard. His men grumbled (enlisted men call officers like Pantano \"motarded\"\u2014motivated to the point of retardation). But he believed that the more they trained, the fitter they were, the more chance they had of surviving a real war. The effort paid off. In more than 40 combat operations, the platoon suffered one casualty\u2014a shrapnel nick from an incoming mortar round. Then the insurgency erupted. Newly arrived units took more casualties in a few days than their predecessors had in eight months.\"Pantano went to Iraq in February 2004 with 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines. This was quickly followed by the intense fighting in Fallujah during Operation Vigilant Resolve in April 2004.",
        "Incident, hearing and aftermath": "On April 15, 2004, acting on intelligence extracted from captured insurgents, Lieutenant Pantano led his platoon against a compound near the town of Mahmudiyah. As the platoon approached the compound, they saw a vehicle with two Iraqis in it. Pantano ordered his men to stop the vehicle and to have the occupants of the vehicle handcuffed. The vehicle was searched for weapons. Lieutenant Pantano remained with the captives, while the rest of his platoon secured the compound. The compound was deserted, but his men found a cache of arms, including \"several mortar aiming stakes, a flare gun, three AK47 rifles, 10 AK magazines with assault vests and IED making material\".When Pantano learned that the compound contained weapons, he ordered Sergeant Daniel Coburn and Corpsman George Gobles to watch for enemies. He then released the captives from their bonds so they could search the vehicle again more thoroughly. According to a statement Lieutenant Pantano made to military investigators in June 2004, he then used hand signals to order the captives to search the vehicle again. According to Pantano, during the search of the vehicle he felt the Iraqis posed a threat to him. They were talking and Pantano believed they were conspiring together. When they both turned to face each other he shouted \"Stop!\" in both Arabic and English, and when they did not stop, he shot them. He later stated: \"I then changed magazines and continued to fire until the second magazine was empty...I had made a decision that when I was firing I was going to send a message to these Iraqis and others that when we say, 'No better friend, No worse enemy,' we mean it. I had fired both magazines into the men, hitting them with about 80 percent of my rounds.\"In June 2004, Sergeant Coburn, whom Pantano had previously demoted, registered a complaint about the incident, triggering a Naval Criminal Investigative Service probe. On February 1, 2005, Pantano was charged with two counts of premeditated murder, and faced the death penalty if convicted.On April 14, 2005, Pantano tried to waive his right to an Article 32 pretrial hearing, in an effort to speed the process toward a court martial. Pantano claimed that the government was withholding key evidence and witnesses and according to a statement made by his mother, waived his right to a hearing \"in order to get a Military Judge to compel the prosecution to produce witnesses and evidence in his case.\" The request was denied and the Article 32 hearing was held on April 26, 2005 with Major Mark Winn as the presiding officer.Prior to Pantano's Article 32 hearing the Department of Defense had maintained that it was impossible to do a post-mortem examination on the corpses of Lieutenant Pantano's captives because they were buried in a cemetery that was in an area that was not under American control. However, shortly before the hearing and a year after the incident itself, the bodies were exhumed. The autopsy report was released the day after the Article 32 recommendation was made and, according to The Washington Times, confirmed Lt. Pantano's testimony that he had shot the men as they approached him.",
        "Pantano's statements": "Pantano acknowledged leaving a sign on a car above the corpses that said, \"No better friend, No worse enemy,\" but then returned to remove it after one of his colleagues called it 'inappropriate'. This phrase is the motto of his Marine Corps battalion, and is promoted by his battalion commander as the combat philosophy of their unit. The slogan is also a popular Marine saying popularized by Lieutenant General James Mattis, then commanding general of the 1st Marine Division. In an interview with the BBC from March 20, 2005, Lieutenant Pantano said, \"I'm a New Yorker and 9/11 was a pretty significant event for me, our duty as Marines is, quite frankly, to export violence to the four corners of the globe, to make sure that this doesn't happen again.\"",
        "Witnesses": "Navy Corpsman George Gobles was present but did not witness the danger Lieutenant Pantano reported, because he was looking outwards, as ordered. He later stated when he turned back he saw the Iraqis trying to run away. Sergeant Coburn is reported to have said \"As soon as I turned my back, Lt. Pantano opened [fire] with approximately 45 rounds.\" Pantano's defense counsels have said they believe that Sergeant Daniel Coburn's account should not be given any credit, because he was disgruntled, having been demoted recently by Pantano.Sergeant Coburn gave several interviews to the media after being ordered not to do so by a superior officer. A report by the officer investigating the claims found \"a great deal of discrepancies and conflicting testimony given by Sgt. Coburn\", and noted that he might have been prompted to make his allegations by his numerous poor performance reports.In his testimony at Pantano's hearing, Corporal \"O\" described interviewing the two captives. He described seeing the vehicle being searched by other Marines, including the removal of its seats. He described seeing the corpses of the captives, following the shooting, face down, with the heads and torsos in the vehicle and their knees resting on the ground, as if Pantano shot the captives in the back while they were kneeling facing the vehicle. Corporal \"O\" described the sight as \"weird\".\n\n\"Sergeant M\", a counter intelligence specialist whose full name couldn't be released, testified that when he questioned the two Iraqi men, they lied and said there were no weapons in the house they fled from. Marines found three AK-47 assault rifles with loaded magazines and mortar aiming stakes, in addition to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein propaganda in the house.\nSergeant M said he believed the men were probably insurgents, and they were not going to be released.\nSergeant M and Petty Officer 3rd Class George Gobles, the Navy corpsman attached to Pantano's platoon, both testified that Pantano was a good leader who frequently made himself available to the Iraqi people.\n\n\"He said we should always present ourselves as humanitarians and greet them with smiles on our face,\" Gobles said. \"That was the way he was, and that was the way he taught us to be.\"\nIn his closing arguments, Pantano's lawyer argued the following as justification for the killings:\n\nWhat you have to remember is you can't import civilian standards into a combat situation. This isn't Chicago. This is Iraq, Indian country....",
        "Recommendations": "Major Winn recommended to Major General Richard Huck, commander of Lieutenant Pantano's division, that the murder charges be dropped and Pantano be held to account for desecration of the corpses. It was his assessment that Sergeant Coburn was an uncredible witness.\n\nThe officer who conducted last month's hearing, Lt. Col. Mark E. Winn, recommended in a report to General Huck that criminal charges were not warranted, but sharply criticized Lieutenant Pantano's decision to have the car stopped and to focus so closely on the two men to begin with. Colonel Winn recommended nonjudicial discipline, because the sign and the number of rounds fired were in his opinion unwarranted and excessive. Lieutenant Edwards said, however, that General Huck would not issue any nonjudicial punishment.\nPantano's testimony regarding the shooting incident were corroborated by the forensic evidence discovered in the process of exhuming the bodies and the subsequent autopsies.\n\n the spokesman, Second Lt. Barry Edwards, said of the autopsy. \"The initial findings corroborated Second Lieutenant Pantano's version of the events.\" Lieutenant Edwards would not elaborate further on the autopsy results.\nUnder U.S. military law, the decision as to whether a court-martial should take place lay solely with General Huck, who dropped all charges.",

Ivanka and her husband were pushing for Powell. Reportedly the president was happy with Powell's performance so far and considered the idea, but in July 2017 chose Homeland Security Secretary and former General John F. Kelly.",
        "National Security Council": "On March 15, 2017, Powell was named to the post of Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, all the while retaining her economic position as well. The impetus for this assignment came from the recently named national security advisor, H. R. McMaster, who himself was responding to people outside the administration suggesting her name.In April 2017 The New York Times labeled Powell a \"rising star\" in the national security establishment, an appellation echoed by Vogue magazine, while the Associated Press wrote that \"Dina Powell has quietly established herself as a White House power.\" Additionally, The Washington Post wrote that \"she is one of the most interesting figures in the new administration.\" In part this level of attention was because in that month, McMaster elevated the Deputy for Strategy position to a higher role within the NSC, meaning that Powell came to attend both the Principals Committee and National Security Council Deputies Committee. For her part, Powell assisted McMaster in his development of working relationships with various members of the Cabinet. In addition, Powell attempted to guide McMaster on the best ways to have useful interchanges with the chief executive himself.Regarding the May 2017 report of a Donald Trump revelation of classified information to Russia, during which Powell was present in the room, she stated: \"This story is false.\" However this soon-to-be infamous, unannounced meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak was as it happened where Trump was later revealed to have disclosed Israeli intelligence. While she dissembled to cover up the president's error, he later admitted to having revealed these secrets.\n\nShe was among the top officials escorting the chief executive on his first foreign trip, which in May 2017 started with a two-day stay in Saudi Arabia. She had been heavily involved in the planning for the Middle Eastern portion of the trip. She was involved in several negotiations with Middle Eastern parties, where she was sometimes the only woman at the table. She also ensured that one of the headliner speeches made reference to women's rights in Saudi Arabia. Powell's prior experience in government and her set of contacts in the Arab world played a key role in making the first part of the trip a successful venture, and she had done some of advance work prior to the trip.Powell was one of the key figures in securing the release of Egyptian aid worker Aya Hijazi. Beginning in June 2017, Powell involved U.S. efforts to free assorted American hostages held in countries overseas, particularly in agency of informing families. The following month she was one of those accompanying on the trip to Poland and Germany en toward the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit.\nShe then went to the Middle East on the next Kushner peace process trip. This took place in late August 2017 and also made the involvement of envoy Jason Greenblatt. By this time the likes of Bannon and Gorka were gone from the White House while Powell was still an ascendant force there. The trip was viewed positively within the Administration, which continued to think that an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal was achievable. This was followed by a secret trip to the Middle East made by Kushner, Powell, and others. By November 2017 she was part of a \"core four\" drafting a plan for a comprehensive Middle East peace, along with Kushner, Greenblatt, and U.S. Ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman. Given that the other three were Orthodox Jews with various ties to Israel, Powell was the only native-born Egyptian.A major accomplishment of Powell in December 2017, was the completion of the administration's National Security Strategy document. She worked on it intensively with McMaster and senior NSC staffer Nadia Schadlow. In doing so they talked with numerous national security experts and stakeholders as well as gaining the buy-in of Cabinet-level officials.",
        "Departure": "On December 8, 2017, it was announced that Powell would be leaving the administration in early 2018, subsequently elaborated to be after a delayed vice presidential trip to the Middle East had been initiated. Powell planned to return to her life in New York, with a goal of spending more time with her family.White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that Powell is a \"trusted advisor\", said that Powell had only ever planned to stay for a year, and indicated that Powell would \"continue to support the President's agenda and work on Middle East policy.\"Four administration officials indicated that the decision to leave really was hers. Several officials viewed her departure as a significant loss for the White House. NSC staffer Nadia Schadlow was chosen to replace Powell.",
        "Possibilities of returning": "In October 2018, following the sudden resignation of Nikki Haley as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Powell was reported to be one of the leading candidates to replace her. Indeed, the President said so explicitly, that she was under consideration among others. The possibility of appointing Powell faced significant opposition from some within the Administration, including Bolton. Some of the arguments against her revolved around her globalist orientations, with the allegation that she was not fully aligned with the chief executive's \"America First\" approach. Also, Powell was reportedly leery of going through a likely contentious confirmation hearing before the United States Senate. Ultimately, Powell announced to friends the time was not right for her family or Goldman Sachs, and by October 11 she told the White House that she was withdrawing from consideration.However, after picked Heather Nauert withdrew from consideration in February 2019 due to nanny issues, Powell's name once again emerged as a possible choice for the position. One report had her as one of the two leading candidates. However Kelly Knight Craft was chosen and it was unclear if Powell was ever interested or in serious consideration.Also around this time, Powell was also considered to become the first female president of the World Bank. She was also under consideration for White House Chief of Staff.",
        "Harvard Kennedy School fellow": "On February 12, 2018 it was announced that Powell would be joining the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs within the bounds of the Harvard Kennedy School. Her mission would be to teach diplomacy and ideas and practices of foreign affairs, and her capacity would be that of a non-residential senior fellow.",
        "Return to Goldman Sachs": "Later in February 2018 it was announced that Powell would return to Goldman Sachs. The position would be on the firm's Management Committee.In the following years she was made Goldman\u2019s global head of sustainability and inclusive growth. She was also made head of the firm's Sovereign Fund, a role that per the firm involves her being \"responsible for helping build and enhance the firm\u2019s relationships with global sovereign clients.\"",
        "Second marriage and role in husband's career": "By 2017, Dina and Richard Powell were no longer married.Instead, by 2018 Powell was engaged to financier and former government official David McCormick. In 2019, she and McCormick were married. She subsequently went by the name, sometimes, of Dina Powell McCormick. At that time David McCormick was under consideration for U.S. Secretary of Defense. He did not get that position. \nIn 2022, however, David McCormick became a top contender for the Republican nomination in the 2022 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania. Powell became strongly involved, accompanying him to Mar-a-Lago in an attempt to secure an endorsement for him from her former boss, the former president. A number of other former administration officials were supporting McCormick, but Powell was the most important of them. Powell's ties to the former president were considered crucial in potentially counteracting some  negative remarks that McCormick had made about the formed president in the past. There were reports in the press, denied by some, that Powell hinted that McCormick's rival Dr. Oz would be unelectable due to his Muslim background. Some of those close to Powell expressed dismay that she would make such an argument, given her own background. The couple also emphasized the fact of Oz's dual citizenship. The efforts did not have success, as the endorsement went to Oz.The Republican primary election was extremely close and went to a recount phase, but in the end McCormick lost to Oz. Oz proceeded to lose the general election, and by some reports the former president blamed his own wife for leading him to endorse Oz in the primary.Powell's time as a political spouse may not be at end, however, as McCormick is contemplating a run in the 2024 Pennsylvania Senate election], meaning in particular the 2024 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania.",
        "Foundation chair": "In October 2022, Powell was named the new chair of the Robin Hood Foundation, a venture philanthropy that seeks to alleviate poverty in New York. She is to take the position effective early 2023. She had previously been vice chair of the fund, and helped it coordinate response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.",
        "Awards and honors": "Dina Habib Powell was selected as one of the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders. The selection happened sometime prior to or in 2010.She received the Outstanding Young Texas Ex Award, associated with  the University of Texas, in 2006.In 2007, Powell was presented with an American by Choice Award during a special naturalization ceremony performed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; the award recognizes outstanding achievements of naturalized U.S. citizens.In 2008, she received the inaugural Young Alumna Award from Ursuline Academy of Dallas.\nIn 2009, Powell was named a Great Immigrant by the Carnegie Corporation of New York for her role in public service and contributions to American life.In 2017, she was the honored speaker for a State Department dinner in acknowledgment of the Fortune/U.S. State Department Global Women's Mentoring Partnership. At the same time Working Mother named her as one of the 50 Most Powerful Moms of 2017."

    "Romano Prodi": {
        "Introduction": "Romano Antonio Prodi  (Italian: [ro\u02c8ma\u02d0no \u02c8pr\u0254\u02d0di] (listen); born 9 August 1939) is an Italian politician, economist, academic, senior civil servant, and business executive who served as the tenth president of the European Commission from 1999 to 2004. He served twice as Prime Minister of Italy, first from 18 May 1996 to 21 October 1998, and then from 17 May 2006 to 8 May 2008. Prodi is considered the founder of the Italian centre-left and one of the most prominent and iconic figures of the so-called Second Republic. He is often nicknamed Il Professore (\"The Professor\") due to his academic career.A former professor of economics and international advisor to Goldman Sachs, Prodi ran as lead candidate of The Olive Tree coalition, winning the 1996 Italian general election and serving as Prime Minister until 1998. Following the victory of his coalition The Union over the House of Freedoms led by Silvio Berlusconi in the 2006 Italian general election, Prodi took power again. On 24 January 2008, he lost a vote of confidence in the Senate and consequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to President Giorgio Napolitano; he continued in office for almost four months for routine business until early elections were held and a new government was formed. Prodi has been the first left-leaning candidate to ever come first at legislative elections since 1921 and to manage to form a government without the need of opponents' parliamentary support.\nOn 14 October 2007, Prodi became the first president of the Democratic Party upon foundation of the party. On 12 September 2008, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon selected Prodi as president of the African Union\u2013United Nations peacekeeping panel. Since 2021, he is serving as the United Nations Special Envoy for the Sahel.",
        "Personal life": "Prodi was born in Scandiano, near Reggio Emilia, in 1939; he is the eighth of nine children. His father Mario Prodi was an engineer grown up in a peasant family, and his mother Enrichetta was an elementary school teacher. Most of the brothers are, or have been, university professors, among them Giovanni Prodi had been professor of mathematical analysis, Vittorio Prodi of physics as well as MEP, Paolo Prodi of modern history, Franco Prodi of atmospheric physics, and Giorgio Prodi of general pathology.In 1969, he married Flavia Franzoni, at that time a student, who later became an economist and university professor. The couple was married by Camillo Ruini, now a well-known cardinal. They have two sons, Giorgio and Antonio. He spends the summer holidays in the coastal town of Castiglione della Pescaia.",
        "Academic career": "After completing his secondary education at the  Liceo Ludovico Ariosto in Reggio Emilia, Prodi graduated in law at Milan's Universit\u00e0 Cattolica in 1961 with a thesis on the role of Protectionism in the development of Italian industry. He then carried out postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics.Prodi has received almost 20 honorary degrees from institutions in Italy, and from the rest of Europe, North America, Asia and Africa.",
        "Early political career": "No information",
        "Ministry of Industry and Moro's kidnapping": "On 25 November 1978 Prodi was appointed Minister of Industry, Commerce and Crafts in the government of the Christian Democratic leader Giulio Andreotti. Even if he was a DC member, Prodi was widely considered a \"technical minister\". As minister, he promoted a law, known as \"Prodi law', which aimed a regulating of the extraordinary state administration procedure for the rescue of large enterprises in crisis.On 2 April 1978, Prodi and other teachers at the University of Bologna passed on a tip-off that revealed the whereabouts of the safe house where the kidnapped Aldo Moro, the former Prime Minister, was being held captive by the Red Brigades. Prodi claimed he had been given this tip-off by the founders of the Christian Democracy party, contacted from beyond the grave via a s\u00e9ance and a Ouija board. Whilst during this supposed s\u00e9ance Prodi thought the word Gradoli referred to a town on the outskirts of Rome, it probably referred to the Roman address of a Red Brigades safe house, located at no. 96, Via Gradoli.\n\nThe information was trusted and a police group made an armed blitz in the town of Gradoli, 80 km from Rome, on the following day, 6 April though Moro was not found.Prodi spoke to the Italian parliament's commission about the case in 1981. In the notes of the Italian parliament commission on terrorism, the s\u00e9ance is described as a fake, used to hide the true source of the information. In 1997 Giulio Andreotti declared that the information came from the Bologna section of Autonomia Operaia, a far-left organization with some ties with the Red Brigades, and that Francesco Cossiga also knew the true source. Judge Ferdinando Imposimato considered Andreotti's theory as \"possible\", but accused him of having kept information that could have been valuable in a trial about Moro's murder.Moro's widow later declared that she had repeatedly informed the police that a via Gradoli existed in Rome, but the investigators did not consider it; some replied to her that the street did not appear in Rome's maps. This is confirmed by other Moro relatives, but strongly denied by Francesco Cossiga, who served as Interior Minister during Moro's kidnapping.In the 1990s the s\u00e9ance matter was reopened by the Italian parliament's commission on terrorism. While Prodi (then Prime Minister) declared that he had no time for an interview, both Baldassarri (senator and vice-minister in two Berlusconi cabinets) and Cl\u00f2 (Minister of Industry in Lamberto Dini's cabinet and owner of the house where the s\u00e9ance was performed) responded to the call: they confirmed the circumstances of the s\u00e9ance, and that the word \"Gradoli\" had appeared in several sessions, even if the participants had changed.Later, other Italian members of the European Commission claimed Prodi had invented this story to conceal the real source of the tip-off, which they believed to have originated somewhere among the far-left Italian political groups.This issue came back again in 2005, when Prodi was accused of being \"a KGB man\" by Mario Scaramella. The same accusation was raised in 2002 by the Mitrokhin Commission.\nThis claim was further repeated by Gerard Batten, the Member of the European Parliament for London who claimed he was informed of this by his constituent and former FSB operative, Alexander Litvinenko. The 2018 February 16 indictment of Paul Manafort unsealed on 23 February as part of the Mueller special counsel investigation alleges that Foreign Politicians hypothesized to be Prodi and Alfred Gusenbauer took payments exceeding $2m from Manafort to promote the case of his client, Viktor Yanukovich.",
        "Business and administrative career": "After leaving his position in 1989, Prodi ran the Bologna based consulting company Analisi e Studi Economici, which he jointly owned along with his wife. Between 1990 and 1993 the company earned \u00a31.4 million, most of which was paid by the investment bank Goldman Sachs.",
        "Second term as IRI President": "In 1993, he was between the main candidates to become Prime Minister at the head of a technocratic government, but the Governor of the Bank of Italy Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was chosen for this office by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.In 1993\u20131994, Prodi was appointed again President of the IRI, by Ciampi, where he oversaw extensive privatization of public assets. For his activities in this period Prodi would later twice come under investigation \u2013 firstly for an alleged conflict of interest in relation to contracts awarded to his own economic research company in relation to the Italdel-Siemens merger, and secondly concerning the sale of the loss-making state-owned food conglomerate SME to the multinational Unilever, for which he had previously been a paid consultant.Prodi's former employer Goldman Sachs was involved in both of the deals. In February 2007 the Italian Treasury Police raided the Milan office of Goldman Sachs, where they removed a file called \"MTononi/memo-Prodi02.doc\". They also obtained a letter to Siemens from the Frankfurt office of Goldman Sachs regarding the Italdel deal, which revealed that Prodi was made the Senior Advisor of Goldman Sachs International in Italy in March 1990. In November 1996, after Prodi had been elected Prime Minister, Rome prosecutor Guiseppa Geremia concluded that there was enough evidence to press charges against Prodi for conflict of interest in the Unilever deal. The case was however shut down within weeks by superiors, while Geremia was \"exiled to Sardinia\".",
        "First term as Prime Minister (1996\u20131998)": "On 25 May 1994, Prodi went to Palazzo Chigi to announce his resignation as IRI President to the new Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi; the resignation had been formalised on 31 May and became effective on 22 July.On 11 August, Prodi announced to the Gazzetta di Reggio of his intent to enter politics. A few months earlier, Prodi had rejected a proposal from the Italian People's Party (PPI) to run for the 1994 European election.",
        "The Olive Tree and 1996 election": "On 13 February 1995 Prodi, along with his close friend Arturo Parisi, founded his political alliance The Olive Tree. Prodi's aim was to build a centre-left coalition composed by centrist and leftist parties, opposed to the centre-right alliance led by Silvio Berlusconi, who resigned from the office of Prime Minister few weeks before, when Lega Nord withdrew his support to the government.\nThe movement was immediately supported by Mariotto Segni, leader of the centrist Segni Pact; after few weeks the post-communist Democratic Party of the Left of Massimo D'Alema, the PPI and the Federation of the Greens also joined the Olive Tree coalition.\nOn 19 February 1996, the outgoing Prime Minister Lamberto Dini announced that he would run in the election with a new party called Italian Renewal, allied with Prodi's Olive Tree rather than Berlusconi's Pole for Freedoms. Shortly after Berlusconi claimed that Dini \"copied his electoral programme\".On election day, Prodi's Olive Tree coalition won over Berlusconi's Pole for Freedoms, becoming the first coalition composed of a post-communist party to win a general election since the Second World War. In the Senate, The Olive Tree obtained the majority, but in the Chamber, it required the external support of Communist Refoundation Party.\nOn 17 May 1996, Prodi received from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro the task of forming a new government. He ultimately formed a 23-member cabinet that included 16 PDS ministers (including Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni) and 10 PDS junior ministers\u2013the first (former) Communists to take part in government in half a century.",
        "Policies": "Prodi's economic programme consisted in continuing the past governments' work of restoration of the country's economic health, in order to pursue the then seemingly unreachable goal of leading the country within the strict European Monetary System parameters in order to allow the country to join the Euro currency. He succeeded in this in little more than six months.\nDuring his first premiership, Prodi faced the Albanian civil war; his government proposed the so-called Operation Alba (\"Sunrise\"), a multinational peacekeeping force sent to Albania in 1997 and led by Italy. It was intended to help the Albanian government restore law and order in their troubled country after the 1997 rebellion in Albania.\n\nFollowing the degenerating loss of administrative control by the Government in the first days of March 1997, culminating in the desertion of most Police and many Republican Guard and Army units, leaving their armouries open to the inevitable looting which soon followed, several Nations autonomously helped evacuate their Nationals, causing wider concerns about the fate of others. The UN Security Council therefore agreed United Nations Security Council Resolution 1101 as a stop-gap operation to manage this and buy time, laying the foundations for another International Organisation to manage a planned reconstruction, which after six weeks of debate fell to the Western European Union, creating the Multinational Albanian Police Element around a command structure of Italian Military Carabinieri, which actually undertook the work of Judicial and Police reconstruction, extending into the elimination of the economic causes of the crisis.\nThe Italian 3rd Army Corps assumed responsibility for the stop-gap mission as Operation Alba, the first multinational Italian-led Mission since World War II. Eleven contributing European Nations brought humanitarian aid to a country that was in a dramatic economic and political situation.",
        "Resignation": "Prodi's government fell in 1998 when the Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its external support. This led to the formation of a new government led by Massimo D'Alema as Prime Minister. There are those who claim that D'Alema, along with People's Party leader Franco Marini, deliberately engineered the collapse of the Prodi government to become Prime Minister himself. As the result of a vote of no confidence in Prodi's government, D'Alema's nomination was passed by a single vote. This was the first occasion in the history of the Italian Republic on which a vote of no confidence had ever been called; the Republic's many previous governments had been brought down by a majority \"no\" vote on some crucially important piece of legislation (such as the budget).",
        "President of the European Commission (1999\u20132004)": "In September 1999 Prodi, a strong supporter of European Integration, became President of the European Commission, thanks to the support of both the conservative European People's Party, the social-democratic Party of European Socialists and the centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party in the European Parliament.\nHis commission took office on 13 September 1999 following the scandal and subsequent resignation of the Santer Commission which had damaged the reputation of the institution. It took over from the interim Mar\u00edn Commission. The College consisted of 20 Commissioners which grew to 30 following the Enlargement of the European Union in 2004. It was the last commission to see two members allocated to the larger member states. This commission (the 10th) saw in increase in power and influence following Amsterdam Treaty. Some in the media described president Prodi as being the first \"Prime Minister of the European Union\".",
        "Amsterdam Treaty": "It was during Prodi's presidency, in 2002, that 11 EU member states ditched their national currencies and adopted the euro as their common currency. This commission (the 10th) saw an increase in power and influence following the Amsterdam Treaty.\nThe treaty was the result of long negotiations which began in Messina, Sicily, on 2 June 1995, nearly forty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and reached completion in Amsterdam on 18 June 1997. Following the formal signing of the Treaty on 2 October 1997, the member states engaged in an equally long and complex ratification process. The European Parliament endorsed the treaty on 19 November 1997, and after two referendums and 13 decisions by parliaments, the member states finally concluded the procedure. Under this treaty the member states agreed to devolve certain powers from national governments to the European Parliament across diverse areas, including legislating on immigration, adopting civil and criminal laws, and enacting foreign and security policy (CFSP), as well as implementing institutional changes for expansion as new member nations join the EU.\nDue to this increased power of the Commission President, some media described President Prodi as being the first \"Prime Minister of the European Union\".",
        "Nice Treaty": "As well as the enlargement and Amsterdam Treaty, the Prodi Commission also saw the signing and enforcement of the Treaty of Nice as well as the conclusion and signing of the European Constitution: in which he introduced the \"Convention method\" of negotiation. The treaty was signed by European leaders on 26 February 2001 and came into force on 1 February 2003.\nIt amended the Maastricht Treaty (or the Treaty on European Union) and the Treaty of Rome (or the Treaty establishing the European Community which, before the Maastricht Treaty, was the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community). The Treaty of Nice reformed the institutional structure of the European Union to withstand eastward expansion, a task which was originally intended to have been done by the Amsterdam Treaty, but failed to be addressed at the time. The entry into force of the treaty was in doubt for a time, after its initial rejection by Irish voters in a referendum in June 2001. This referendum result was reversed in a subsequent referendum held a little over a year later.",
        "2004 enlargement and of the mandate": "In 2004, his last year as Commission President, the European Union was enlarged to admit several more member nations, most formerly part of the Soviet bloc. It was the largest single expansion of the European Union (EU), in terms of territory, number of states, and population to date; however, it was not the largest in terms of gross domestic product. It occurred on 1 May 2004.\nThe simultaneous accessions concerned the following countries (sometimes referred to as the \"A10\" countries): Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Seven of these were part of the former Eastern Bloc (of which three were from the former Soviet Union and four were and still are members of the Central European alliance Visegr\u00e1d Group), one of the former Yugoslavia (together sometimes referred to as the \"A8\" countries), and the remaining two were Mediterranean islands and former British colonies.\nPart of the same wave of enlargement was the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, who were unable to join in 2004, but, according to the Commission, constitute part of the fifth enlargement.\nThe commission was due to leave office on 31 October 2004, but due to opposition from the European parliament to the proposed Barroso Commission which would succeed it, it was extended and finally left office on 21 November 2004. When his mandate expired, Prodi returned to domestic politics.",
        "Return to Italian politics (2005\u20132006)": "No information",
        "The Union primary election": "Shortly before the end of his term as President of the European Commission, Prodi returned to national Italian politics at the helm of the enlarged centre-left coalition, The Union.\n\nHaving no party of his own, in order to officially state his candidacy for the 2006 general election, Prodi came up with the idea of an apposite primary election, the first of such kind to be ever introduced in Europe and seen by its creator (Prodi himself) as a democratic move to bring the public and its opinion closer to the Italian politics.\nWhen the primary elections were first proposed, they were mostly meant as a plebiscite for Romano Prodi, since there were no other candidates for the leadership of the coalition. The secretary of the Communist Refoundation Party, Fausto Bertinotti, then announced he would run for the leadership, even if only to act as a symbolic candidate, to avoid a one-candidate election. After some time, more candidates were presented, like Union of Democrats for Europe leader Clemente Mastella, Italy of Values leader and former magistrate Antonio Di Pietro, Federation of the Greens leader Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio and others few minor candidates.The primary election may have been foreseen an easy win for Romano Prodi, with the other candidates running mostly to \"measure their strengths\" in the coalition, and they often talked about reaching a certain percentage rather than winning. However, there were rumours of supporters of the House of Freedoms trying to participate in the elections, and vote in favour of Mastella, reputed to be the least competent of the candidates and the least likely to win against Berlusconi, other than the most centrist; other rumours indicated such \"fake\" left-wing voters would vote for Bertinotti, because his leadership would likely lose any grip on the political centre.The election had been held nationwide on 16 October 2005, from 8 am to 10 pm. Poll stations were mainly managed on a voluntary basis; they were hosted mainly in squares, local party quarters, schools, and even restaurants, bars, campers and a hairdresser; some polling stations were also provided outside the country for Italians abroad. Most of the party leaders claimed a result of 1 million voters would be a good success for the election, but over four million people for the occasion went to cast a vote in the primary election.",
        "Second term as Prime Minister (2006\u20132008)": "No information",
        "Italian 2006 general election": "After having won the centre-left primary election, Prodi led The Union coalition in the 2006 election. The Union was a heterogeneous alliance, which was formed by centrist parties like UDEUR and communists like PRC and Party of Italian Communists.\nProdi led his coalition to the electoral campaign preceding the election, eventually on 9 and 10 April won by a very narrow margin of 25,000 votes, and a final majority of two seats in the Senate. Initial exit polls suggested a victory for Prodi, but the results narrowed as the count progressed.  On 11 April 2006, Prodi declared victory; Berlusconi never conceded defeat explicitly but this is not required by the Italian law.\nPreliminary results showed The Union leading the House of Freedoms in the Chamber of Deputies, with 340 seats to 277, thanks to obtaining a majority bonus (actual votes were distributed 49.81% to 49.74%). One more seat is allied with The Union (Aosta Valley) and 7 more seats in the foreign constituency. The House of Freedoms had secured a slight majority of Senate seats elected within Italy (155 seats to 154), but The Union won 4 of the 6 seats allocated to voters outside Italy, giving them control of both chambers.On 19 April 2006, Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that Prodi had indeed won the election, winning control of the Chamber of Deputies by only 24,755 votes out of more than 38 million votes cast, and winning 158 seats in the Senate to 156 for Berlusconi's coalition. Even so, Berlusconi refused to concede defeat, claiming unproven fraud.",
        "Government formation": "Prodi's appointment was somewhat delayed, as the outgoing President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, ended his mandate in May, not having enough time for the usual procedure (consultations made by the President, appointment of a Prime Minister, the motion of confidence and oath of office). After the acrimonious election of Giorgio Napolitano to replace Ciampi, Prodi could proceed with his transition to government. On 16 May he was invited by Napolitano to form a government. The following day, 17 May 2006, Prodi and his second cabinet were sworn into office.\nProdi's new cabinet drew in politicians from across his centre-left winning coalition, in addition to Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, an unelected former official of the European Central Bank with no partisan membership. Romano Prodi obtained the support for his cabinet on 19 May at the Senate and on 23 May at the Chamber of Deputies.\nThe coalition led by Prodi, thanks to the electoral law which gave the winner a sixty-seat majority, can count on a good majority in the Chamber of Deputies but only on a very narrow majority in the Senate. The composition of the coalition was heterogeneous, combining parties of communist ideology, the Party of Italian Communists and Communist Refoundation Party, within the same government as parties of Catholic inspiration, Democracy is Freedom \u2013 The Daisy and UDEUR. The latter was led by Clemente Mastella, former chairman of Christian Democracy. Therefore, according to critics, it was difficult to have a single policy in different key areas, such as economics and foreign politics (for instance, Italian military presence in Afghanistan).",
        "Foreign policy": "In foreign policy, the Prodi II Cabinet continued the engagement in Afghanistan, under UN command, while withdrawing troops from post-invasion Iraq on 18 May 2006, when Prodi laid out some sense of his new foreign policy, pledging to withdraw Italian troops from Iraq and called the Iraq War a \"grave mistake that has not solved but increased the problem of security\".The major effort of foreign minister Massimo D'Alema concerned the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon War, being the first to offer troops to the UN for the constitution of the UNIFIL force, and assuming its command in February 2007. In fact, Prodi had a key role in the creation of a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon following the Israel-Lebanon conflict.\nItaly led negotiations with the Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni and was proposed by Israel to head the multinational peacekeeping mission, although the dangers of the mission for Italian troops sparked warnings from the center-right opposition that it could prove a \"kamikaze\" mission, with the peacekeepers sandwiched between Israel and the well-armed Hezbollah. Prodi and D'Alema pledged Italy's willingness to enforce the United Nations resolution on Lebanon and urged other European Union member states to do the same because the stability of the Middle East should be a chief concern for Europeans.",
        "Coalition's troubles": "Prodi's government faced a crisis over policies in early 2007, after just nine months of government. Three ministers in Prodi's Cabinet boycotted a vote in January to continue funding for Italian troop deployments in Afghanistan. Lawmakers approved the expansion of the US military base Caserma Ederle at the end of January, but the victory was so narrow that Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli criticised members of the coalition who had not supported the government. At around the same time, Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, of the coalition member UDEUR, said he would rather see the government fall than support its unwed couples legislation.Tens of thousands of people marched in Vicenza against the expansion of Caserma Ederle, which saw the participation of some leading far-left members of the government. Harsh debates followed in the Italian Senate on 20 February 2007. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Massimo D'Alema declared during an official visit in Ibiza, Spain that, without a majority on foreign policy affairs, the government would resign. The following day, D'Alema gave a speech at the Senate representing the government, clarifying his foreign policy and asking the Senate to vote for or against it. In spite of the fear of many senators that Prodi's defeat would return Silvio Berlusconi to power, the Senate did not approve a motion backing Prodi's government foreign policy, two votes shy of the required majority of 160.\n\nAfter a Government meeting on 21 February, Romano Prodi tendered his resignation to the President Giorgio Napolitano, who cut short an official visit to Bologna in order to receive the Prime Minister. Prodi's spokesman indicated that he would only agree to form a new Government \"if, and only if, he is guaranteed the full support of all the parties in the majority from now on.\" On 22 February, centre-left coalition party leaders backed a non-negotiable list of twelve political conditions given by Prodi as conditions of his remaining in office. President Napolitano held talks with political leaders on 23 February to decide whether to confirm Prodi's Government, ask Prodi to form a new government or call fresh elections.Following these talks, on 24 February, President Napolitano asked Prodi to remain in office but to submit to a vote of confidence in both houses. On 28 February, the Senate voted to grant confidence to Prodi's Government. Though facing strong opposition from the centre-right coalition, the vote resulted in a 162\u2013157 victory. Prodi then faced a vote of confidence in the lower house on 2 March, which he won as expected with a large majority of 342\u2013198.On 14 October 2007, Prodi oversaw the merger of two main parties of the Italian centre-left, Democrats of the Left and Democracy is Freedom \u2013 The Daisy, creating the Democratic Party. Prodi himself led the merger of the two parties, which had been planned over a twelve-year period, and became the first President of the party. He announced his resignation from that post on 16 April 2008, two days after the Democratic Party's defeat in the general election.",
        "2008 crisis and resignation": "In early January 2008, Justice Minister and Union of Democrats for Europe's leader Clemente Mastella resigned after his wife Sandra Lonardo was put under house arrest for corruption charges. With three Senators, UDEUR was instrumental to ensure a narrow centre-left majority in the Italian Senate.After first promising to support the government, he later retracted this support, and his party followed, in part also due to pressure from the Vatican, for which the government's proposed laws in regards to registered partnerships of same-sex couples, and other liberal reforms were objectionable. Mastella also cited lack of solidarity from the majority parties after the arrest of his wife, and declared that his party would vote against the government bills since then.\nThe decision of former Minister of Justice Mastella arrived a few days after the confirmation of the Constitutional Court which confirmed the referendum to modify the electoral system. As stated many times by Minister Mastella, if the referendum had been confirmed, it would lead directly to the fall of the government\nand it happened. The fall of the government would disrupt a pending election-law referendum that if passed would make it harder for small parties like Mastella's to gain seats in parliament.The UDEUR defection forced caused Prodi to ask for a confidence vote in both Chambers: he won a clear majority in the Chamber of Deputies on 23 January, but was defeated 156 to 161 (with 1 abstention) in the Senate the next day. He therefore tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to President Giorgio Napolitano, who accepted it and appointed the President of the Senate, Franco Marini, with the task of evaluating possibilities for forming interim government to implement electoral reforms prior to holding elections. Marini, after consultation with all major political forces, acknowledged the impossibility of doing so on 5 February, forcing Napolitano to announce the end of the legislature. Prodi said that he would not seek to lead a new government and snap election were called. In the election that followed in April 2008, Berlusconi's centre-right The People of Freedom and allies defeated the Democratic Party.",
        "After the premiership (2008\u2013present)": "On 19 March 2008, during the political campaign for the snap general election, Romano Prodi stated \"I called it a day with Italian politics and maybe with politics in general.\"On 12 September 2008, Prodi was named by the UN as head of a joint AU-UN panel aimed at enhancing peacekeeping operations in Africa.On 6 February 2009, he was appointed Professor-at-Large at the Watson Institute for International Studies of Brown University. Since 2010 Romano Prodi is the chair for Sino-European dialogue at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS \u2013 Shanghai&Beijing), China's leading business school.\nOn 9 October 2012, Romano Prodi was appointed by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as his Special Envoy for the Sahel. He served in that position until 31 January 2014.Prodi is also a member of the Club de Madrid, an international organization of former democratic statesmen, which works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership. He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.",
        "2013 presidential candidate": "Prodi was drafted by Democratic Party parliamentarians to be President of Italy during the 2013 presidential election after Democratic Party\u2013People of Freedom compromise candidate Franco Marini failed to receive sufficient votes on the first ballot. During the first three rounds of voting, few people cast ballots for Prodi (14 on the first ballot, 13 on the second and 22 on the third).On 16 April 2013, just a few days prior to the fourth ballot, Prodi gave a lectio magistralis at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum entitled \"I grandi cambiamenti della politica e dell'economia mondiale: c'\u00e8 un posto per l'Europa?\" (\"The Great Changes in Politics and the World Economy: Is there Room for Europe?). Prodi was sponsored by the Angelicum and the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi Guglielmo Marconi on behalf of the Political Science program \"Scienze Politiche e del Buon Governo.\"A few days later on 19 April, starting on the fourth ballot Prodi was looked at seriously as a possible candidate. However, Prodi announced he was pulling out of the race for President after more than 100 centre-left electors did not vote for him as he received only 395 (of 504 votes needed to be elected). After this vote, Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of centre-left Democratic Party, announced his resignation as party's secretary. As of September 2020, he is a member of the Italian Aspen Institute.",

Rokos generated $4 billion in profits whilst at Brevan Howard, trading securities tied to interest rates for the firm's flagship Master Fund, including $1.11 billion in 2007, equivalent to 27% of the fund's total profits that year, as well as $549 million in 2008 and $933 million in 2009. His best year for the Brevan Howard Master Fund came in 2011, when he made $1.27 billion for the fund, according to documents filed in his subsequent court case. The same documents also revealed that Rokos personally earned about $900 million during his 10 years at Brevan, a figure dwarfing previous estimates.",
        "Rokos Capital Management": "In 2012, Rokos retired from Brevan Howard, setting up a family office in London's Mayfair to manage his own wealth. But in the summer of 2014, wishing to return to trading, he filed a suit in the Royal Court of Jersey against Brevan Howard contesting the five-year noncompete restrictions which would have prevented him from managing outside capital until at least 2018.The high-profile case was settled out of court in January 2015, clearing the way for Rokos to start his own firm in one of the \"most anticipated hedge-fund launches of recent years\", according to The Wall Street Journal. With investors reportedly forbidden from discussing the launch, Reuters reported that much of the money initially invested in the fund would be provided by Rokos himself, with a primary focus on foreign exchange, fixed income and equity index products in developed markets and relatively liquid emerging markets.Rokos Capital Management began trading in the Autumn of 2015, gaining approximately 20 per cent in its first calendar year (2016). According to the Financial Times, Rokos Capital Management was helped by bets on market moves around Donald Trump's election victory.Rokos was one of a number of hedge fund managers who predicted the UK Referendum vote on EU membership incorrectly, The New York Times wrote that he had told associates that he expected the \"remain\" vote to win. Rokos Capital Management still made money, gaining more than 2.5 percent in a single day immediately after the vote. The performance of Rokos Capital Management in 2016 was followed by two years of indifference, reflecting a difficult trading period for macro hedge funds. In 2017\u20132018, Rokos Capital Management's profits fell by 85% to \u00a322.9 million. Rokos continued to complete the build-out of the firm in readiness for the return of more favourable market conditions.Rokos Capital is one of the biggest and top performing hedge funds in London.",
        "Political donations": "Rokos was one of a number of hedge fund managers who made donations to Britain's Conservative Party in the run-up to the 2015 general election, contributing \u00a31.9 million in total. Since 2015, Rokos has been an occasional donor only to the Party.",
        "Social contributions": "Rokos says little about his charitable giving. It is known that he provides financial support to organisations seeking to guarantee basic human rights and needs, and to initiatives which promote equality of opportunity, especially in education.\nHe has given to Amnesty International and Water Aid, and supports Pro Bono Economics, a charitable organisation which helps other charities to measure performance, improve services and improve impact.He is supporting a five-year fellowship, called the Chris Rokos Fellowship in Evolution and Cancer, at London's Institute of Cancer Research to explore how cancer occurs and why. The fellowship has been awarded to Dr Andrea Sottoriva who is applying Darwinian principles of natural selection in a quest to understand why cancer develops and why it is so difficult to treat.Rokos supports the New Foundation Scholarships programme at Eton College. Mirroring his own educational experience, this initiative offers up to four scholarships for children from schools in the state sector. It is aimed at children from poorer backgrounds who have potential and who would not otherwise be able to gain access to the education which Eton offers.Pembroke College, Oxford University named a quad after Rokos when he gave the lead gift to the campaign which went on to raise \u00a317 million to fund the surrounding buildings complex. He also supports other educational initiatives linked to Pembroke College; notably the Rokos Award Research Scholarships and the Oxford-Rokos Graduate Scholarships. Pembroke undergraduates studying STEM subjects are eligible to apply for the Rokos Awards, which are intended to support students looking to enhance their studies and scientific knowledge through research internships.The Oxford-Rokos Graduate Scholarship is 60% funded by Rokos, and 40% by Oxford University, and covers the entire cost of living and fees for the full duration of a student's course. It is offered to applicants who have \"demonstrated excellent academic ability\", who will \"contribute to the University\u2019s ground-breaking research\", and who are \"expected to go on to contribute to the world as leaders in their field\".Rokos also supports the Rokos Career Development Fellowship in Economics or Economic History at Pembroke College. It is awarded with preference to candidates whose research area matches those of the Fellow in Economics at Pembroke College, Dr Brian A\u2019Hearn, including research on cities and regions, institutions, political economy, technology, labour markets, human capital, and living standards in Europe.Rokos is known to have an interest in art, especially \u2018Old Masters'. In 2010, the Financial Times reported that Rokos was understood to be the buyer of Domenichino's great baroque painting of \"St John the Evangelist\" (1620s). The painting sold at Christie's in December 2010 to a US buyer but its export was deferred. At that point a new buyer \u2013 believed to be Rokos \u2013 came forward to buy the painting and lend it to the National Gallery. Rokos was amongst major donors who in 2012 contributed to the National Gallery's successful Appeal to save Titians's Diana and Actaeon for the nation.",
        "Personal life": "Described by the Daily Telegraph as a highly secretive man, Rokos is rarely seen in his home town of Cleobury Mortimer in Shropshire, as he regularly flies in and out using his own helicopter. Little is known of his personal life. He has property in Wiltshire including the Tottenham Estate near Marlborough (former home of the Earl of Cardigan), the Little Bedwyn Estate, and the Stype estate near Hungerford."

    "Jack Ryan (politician)": {
        "Introduction": "John Clemens Ryan (born October 6, 1959) is an American former investment banker and politician who was a candidate in the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois. In 2000, he retired as an active partner at Goldman Sachs to teach at Hales Franciscan High School, a private Catholic high school in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood.\nHis 2004 campaign for the Senate, against Barack Obama, received widespread media attention for the disclosure of sealed custody documents stemming from his divorce from actress Jeri Ryan. The unsealing of those documents, detailing allegations that Ryan had pressured his wife to perform sexual acts in public, led to Ryan's withdrawal from the campaign.In March 2005, Ryan launched 22nd Century Media, a news media company dedicated to providing hyper-local news in both print and digital media formats. In 2015, Ryan left 22nd Century Media to launch REX, a technology-based real estate services company that works outside the MLS to sell homes.",
        "Early life": "Ryan spent his childhood in Wilmette, Illinois, the son of Helen Marie (Bruns) and Donald Robert Ryan, a managing partner at a trade and clearing house. One of six siblings, he attended New Trier High School. He graduated from high school in 1977 and went on to Dartmouth College, where he graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. He earned his MBA from Harvard Business School and his JD from Harvard Law School, with honors.",
        "Investment banking": "Ryan worked at Casa Juan Diego, a refugee camp for Latinos fleeing the Central American civil wars. He worked for Goldman Sachs as an investment banker and eventual partner, first in New York City, and then in the Chicago branch.In 2000, after Goldman Sachs went public, Ryan's net worth was in the tens of millions. He retired from Goldman as a partner and taught for three years at Hales Franciscan High School in Chicago. He left his teaching position to run for the Senate in 2004.Starting in 2005, he ran 22nd Century Media, which published 15 separate localized newspapers and websites in the Chicago area.He runs REX, a technology-based real estate services company that works outside the MLS to sell homes. Ryan has dedicated the wealth created from the venture to building homes and schools for children. As part of its social mission, for every 50 homes it sells, REX builds a home for someone who doesn't have one.",
        "2004 U.S. Senate race": "Ryan hoped to succeed retiring Republican Peter Fitzgerald in the United States Senate. On March 16, 2004, he won the Republican primary, pitting him against Democrat Barack Obama. However, after his divorce records containing damaging allegations were unsealed and made public, he announced his decision to withdraw his candidacy on June 25, 2004, and officially filed the documentation to do so on July 29. During his Senate campaign, Ryan was a proponent of across-the-board tax cuts and tort reform, reductions in federal spending, as well as a proponent of equal opportunity in education.In 2004, Ryan's staff had Justin Warfel (a campaign worker) follow Barack Obama throughout the day and record everything he did in public on videotape. The tactic backfired when Barack Obama and others, including Ryan's supporters, criticized this activity. Ryan's spokesman apologized and promised that Warfel would give Obama more space. Obama said he was satisfied with Ryan's decision.",
        "Campaign demise": "Ryan married actress Jeri Ryan (n\u00e9e Zimmerman) in 1991; together they have a son, Alex Ryan, born 1994. They divorced in 1999 in California, and the records of the divorce were open but their custody documents were sealed at their mutual request. Five years later, when Ryan's Senate campaign began, the Chicago Tribune newspaper and WLS-TV, the local ABC affiliate, sought to have the records released. On March 3, 2004, several of Ryan's GOP primary opponents urged release of the records. Both Ryan and his wife had agreed to make their divorce records public, but not make the custody records public, claiming that the custody records could be harmful to their son if released. On March 16, 2004, Ryan won the GOP primary with 36 percent to 23 percent against businessman and perennial political candidate Jim Oberweis, who came in second. Obama won the Democratic primary, with 53 percent to 23 percent against Dan Hynes, who came in second.On March 29, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Schnider ruled that several of the Ryans' custody records should be opened to the public. The following week, on April 2, 2004, Barack Obama called on Democrats not to inject them into the campaign. The Ryan campaign characterized Obama's stance as hypocritical because people they alleged to be Obama's backers had been emailing reports about the divorce records before Judge Schnider's decision and urging the press to seek to open them.In May 2004, a Chicago Tribune poll found Ryan trailing Obama 52% to 30%. On June 22, 2004, after receiving a report from the referee, Judge Schnider released the files that were deemed consistent with the interests of Ryan's young child. In those files, Jeri Ryan alleged that Jack Ryan had wanted her to perform sexual acts with him in public in sex clubs in New York City, New Orleans, and Paris, but no sex occurred. Jeri Ryan described one as \"a bizarre club with cages, whips and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling.\" The decision to release these files generated much controversy because it went against both parents' direct request, and because it reversed the earlier decision to seal the papers in the best interest of the child, who had special needs. On the same day, Jim Oberweis, Ryan's defeated opponent in the GOP primary, commented that if the allegations were true, \"it would end the candidacy.\"Ryan's campaign indeed ended less than a week after the custody records were opened, and Ryan officially filed the documentation to withdraw on July 29, 2004. The same party leaders who called for Ryan's resignation chose Alan Keyes as Ryan's replacement in the race; Keyes lost to Obama, 27% to 70%.",
        "Ryan's response": "Subsequent to his withdrawal from the U.S. Senate race in Illinois, Jack Ryan has characterized what happened to him as a \"new low for politics in America\". According to Ryan, it was unprecedented in American politics for a newspaper to sue for access to sealed custody documents. Ryan opposed unsealing the divorce records of Senator John Kerry during Kerry's race against George W. Bush in 2004, and Kerry's divorce records remained sealed. Ryan subsequently made a statement requesting \"Let me be the only person this has happened to. Don't ask for Ted Kennedy's. Don't ask for John McCain's. Don't ask for Joe Lieberman's. Just stop. This is not a good precedent for American society if you really want the best and brightest to run.\"",
        "Local journalism": "Following his political career, Ryan resumed his newspaper business. On February 27, 2014, he launched the Highland Park Landmark, the 12th hyper-local news publication published by his company, 22nd Century Media, and the fifth hyper-local product to serve Chicago's North Shore suburbs. When asked why he chose to enter the news media industry, Ryan told  Chicago Reader, \"I was committed to improving the communities in which we live, and our profession seemed like a very good way to do so.\" Ryan also related that while at Goldman Sachs, he had observed how large retailer chains lost business to \"category killers\" whose specialization in specific products allowed them dominate those markets, as Best Buy and Toys R Us, for example, did with electronics and toys, respectively. Feeling that a similar process would take place with the various sections of traditional newspapers, Ryan felt his speciality was local journalism. Lastly, Ryan felt that the way the media handled the scandal that ended his political career showed that there were ways in which that profession could be improved."

    "Vikram Akula": {
        "Introduction": "Vikram Akula (born 7 November 1968) is an American banker and the founder of SKS Microfinance (now BFIL), a micro finance company and former chairperson of Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd. SKS was an organization that offered microloans and insurance to poor women in India. He stepped down as SKS Chairperson in November 2011 and became Chairperson Emeritus.Akula is also a founding investor and a Director in AgSri, a sustainable agriculture company focused on helping small sugarcane farmers reduce water use, and a Director in Bodhi Educational Society, which establishes schools for underprivileged children in India. In 2006, he was named by TIME magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world for his work in financial inclusion.Akula currently serves as Chairperson of VAYA Finserv Private Limited. Founded in 2014, the India-based company markets financial services to low-income groups on behalf of partner banks.",
        "Early life and education": "Akula's father, Akula.V. Krishna, was a surgeon who settled in Schenectady, New York, where Akula went to school. Akula graduated from Niskayuna High School in 1986 and enrolled at Tufts University, where he graduated as a double major in philosophy and English with honors in 1990. He went to Yale University for a M.A. in International Relations, and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship for an action-research microfinance project in India in 1994\u201395.  He completed his Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago in 2004. In 2019-20, he was a Distinguished Career Fellow at Stanford University.",
        "Career": "Upon graduating from Tufts, Akula returned to India for a short while in 1990 and worked with the Deccan Development Society, a small grassroots rural non-profit organization. He then returned to USA and worked for the Worldwatch Institute in Washington D.C. as a researcher, where he wrote articles about poverty and sustainable development. During his Fulbright, Akula returned to the Deccan Development Society, where he helped manage the organization's microfinance program. Akula saw the limitation of non-profit microfinance and proposed a more market-based approach. He outlines his philosophy in his book, A Fistful of Rice; My Unexpected Quest to End Poverty Through Profitability, published by Harvard Business Press in 2010.",
        "SKS Microfinance": "In 1996, Akula completed his Fulbright and went to the University of Chicago to pursue his Ph.D, which he completed in 2004. As a Ph.D. student, he created a business plan for a for-profit microfinance company and in December 1997, Akula returned to India to set up Swayam Krishi Sangam (SKS) as a vehicle to implement the plan. Initially set up as a non-profit, SKS converted to the for-profit SKS Microfinance in 2005. SKS Microfinance secured a round of equity investment of $11.5 million in March 2007, led by Sequoia Capital. In November 2008, SKS raised an equity investment of $75 million, the largest equity investment raised by an MFI to that date. SKS raised additional equity from Infosys founder Narayan Murthy and Bajaj Allianz, which represented the first-ever microfinance investment by an insurance company.In mid-August 2010, SKS Microfinance had an initial public offering (IPO) on the Bombay Stock Exchange, which raised $350 million and was oversubscribed 14 times and which included anchor investors such as George Soros. According to the company's website, SKS Microfinance has disbursed more than $15 billion in micro-loans.Akula resigned from the role of Executive Chairperson on 23 November 2011 and he relinquished his role as a promoter of SKS on 3 May 2014.",
        "Influences": "When founding SKS, Akula drew inspiration from the work of Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel prize winner and founder of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, one of the world's first microfinance organizations. In a face-to-face debate with Yunus at the 2010 Clinton Global Initiative, Akula insisted that going public is the only way for an MFI to raise sufficient funds to provide micro-loans for billions of poor people in need worldwide.",
        "Controversy": "In late 2010, the state government of Andhra Pradesh accused microfinance companies, including the then market leader SKS, for the  suicides of poor, debt-ridden residents of the state that year. Two investigations into the incident, the first an independent investigation commissioned by SKS, and the second commissioned by an industry umbrella group, both pointed to SKS involvement in the suicides, and said that SKS employees had engaged in illegal practices like verbal and physical harassment, coercion, and public humiliation, in order to recover debts.In an investigative article, Erika Kinetz of the Associated Press, wrote,\"a profound shift in values and incentives at SKS began in 2008\" when Akula left the CEO role. \"Boston-based Sandstone Capital, now SKS' largest investor, made a major investment. It joined U.S. private equity firm Sequoia Capital, which funded Google and Apple and is SKS' largest shareholder, on the board of directors. Akula, who had been chief executive in the company's early days, stepped down in December 2008 but stayed on as chairman. The company brought in new top executives from the worlds of finance and insurance. SKS also began transferring more loans off its books, selling highly rated pools of loans to banks, which then assumed most of the associated risk of borrower default. That freed SKS to push out more and bigger loans. In December 2009, SKS launched a massive sales drive. The \"Incentives Galore\" program ran through February 2010 \u2014 just one month before the company filed its IPO prospectus.\" She noted that Akula tried to stop this. \"In spring 2011, Akula began circulating a plan to spend $10 million to train financial counselors who would make sure clients weren't getting into too much debt and used their loans productively, according to people with firsthand knowledge of the proposal. The plan was never adopted.\" \"SKS Under Spotlight in Suicides\". Wall Street Journal. Associated Press. 24 February 2012. ISSN 0099-9660. Retrieved 5 December 2017.</ref>\nAkula addresses the controversy in his book, Micro-Meltdown: The Inside Story of the Rise, Fall, and Resurgence of the World's Most Valuable Microlender.",

He worked as a systems engineer at IBM in the early 1960s and served as Systems Design Chief for the First U.S. Army at Governors Island.",
        "Consulting career": "Bales joined McKinsey & Company as a management consultant in 1965 and was elected a principal in 1969. From 1978 to 1998, he was a Director of McKinsey & Company. He founded McKinsey's practices in environmental management, information industries, state and local government, and media and communications, and also led the Firm's information technology practice. He served in McKinsey's Board of Directors for seven years and, early in that period, led a project to redefine the Firm's strategy.Bales retired from McKinsey in 1998 but continued as an Emeritus Director and Senior Advisor to McKinsey on environmental and sustainability matters for many years.Bales played the lead role in developing an approach to \"issue mapping\" in order to advise New York Mayor Lindsay's Policy Planning Council on cost-effective strategies for addressing complex urban problems. Its first application was an analysis of Local Law 14 which addressed the choice of allowing apartment houses to incinerate their refuse vs. the option of compacting refuse or hauling raw refuse by the City's Sanitation Department. Bales then played a lead role in forming and staffing an expanded program planning staff and a separate project management staff in City government to help ensure successful analysis and implementation of Mayoral policy decisions.\nBales, along with P.C.

A business system consists of the various elements of the system of activities that a company employs to make and deliver products or services to a target market. At each stage of the system, the company has a range of choices for performing the activities and balancing the overall system to deliver the product or service most cost-effectively.

Born in Tehran, Iran, Banki immigrated to the US to attend college and became a naturalized US citizen in the 1990s. In January 2010, Banki was arrested and charged with violating US sanctions against Iran by the United States Attorney's office in New York City. Ultimately Banki won his case on appeal, and it was permanently closed in July 2012. Banki spoke about his case at a TED Talk in 2014, presenting a case for change in criminal justice.

After completing his PhD, he worked as a management consultant at the New York City office of McKinsey & Company. In January 2010, Banki was arrested and prosecuted by the United States Attorney's office in New York City. He was charged with violating US sanctions against Iran. He spent 22 months in prison before winning his case on appeal in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, with all charges against him related to the sanctions being dismissed. After his release Banki earned a Master of Business Administration from the University of California, Los Angeles, and worked at NBCUniversal.",
        "United States v. Banki case": "No information",
        "Background": "Banki's family lived in Iran and through the early 2000s with his parents' marriage falling apart, the family decided to send a portion of the family assets to the US. Between 2006 and 2009 Banki's family sent proceeds of his parents' divorce settlement (approximately $3.4 million) to him, from Iran to the US. The money came into a single bank account at Bank of America, over multiple transfers through an informal money transfer systems which the defendant argued was legal and the only means of sending money out of Iran at the time. Banki used the majority of this money to purchase an apartment in downtown Manhattan.\nProsecutors argued that over this three-year period Banki had violated the sanctions imposed by the US on Iran. The indictment accused Banki of violating the sanctions law, running an informal underground bank, and helping \"manage, supervise, operate, and conduct\" an unlicensed money transmittal service through which he directly or indirectly facilitated and violated the Iran sanctions. In essence, the charges against Banki stemmed from prosecution allegations that he, as an American citizen, had violated US sanctions on Iran.",
        "Sanctions history": "The United States enforces sanctions against several countries worldwide. These sanctions are instituted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) under the Department of Treasury of the United States.\nUS treasury's OFAC designates family money as exempt from the sanctions law.A detailed letter by former head of Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Richard Newcomb, to the court during the case of US v. Banki outlined the sanctions regiment and intent; undermining the prosecutor's case against Banki as not being in line with the practices of OFAC or the intent of the sanctions. Nor were the charges in line with the agency's approach while Richard Newcomb was head of the agency:\n\"The underlying purpose for these multiple U.S. economic sanctions programs against Iran was to target the Government with the use of economic methods to change the behavior of the leadership in Iran toward the United States and the international community at large, and to thwart Iran's support for and funding of terrorism, its efforts to disrupt the Middle East Peace Process and its development of weapons of mass destruction. Central to the effort was to direct and focus the sanctions impact on the Government of Iran, its leadership, its various agencies, instrumentalities, controlled entities and support structure, including Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and other such organizations necessary for the support and continuation of the current Governmental hierarchy. The industrial and commercial sectors - oil and gas, financial, manufacturing and other sectors that contribute significantly to Iran's economy and the Government's ability to continue its threatening behavior were also of primary concern. The program goal was never intended to target the Iranian people. The Iranian Diaspora is large. As many as 4 million or more Iranians live as expats around the world. It is estimated that there are as many as 800,000 Iranian nationals currently resident in the United States as dual nationals, green card holders or with other visa status. A very large percentage are supporters of U.S. policy toward Iran, and it is the goal of the U.S. government to continue cultivating that support while isolating the government of Iran. In virtually all economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC (with the exception of the 1963 program against Cuba where Cuban nationals were also included as targets), including the Iran sanctions program, it was always understood that there was a dual goal and purpose - to bring as much economic pressure as possible to bear on the intended target without causing unintended hardship and suffering on the civilian population, the very people whose support and assistance the U.S. and the international community will need if and when a successor government emerges.\"",
        "Arrest, indictment and charges": "On January 7th, 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  agents authorized by a grand jury with a search and arrest warrant entered the residence of Mahmoud Reza Banki in New York City and arrested him. He was arraigned before Judge John F. Keenan on an indictment charging him with three counts: 1. Conspiracy to violate the U.S.-imposed Iran sanctions and conspiracy to run an unlicensed money transmittal system, 2. Violation of the Iran sanctions, and 3. Running of an unlicensed money transmittal business. The indictment accused Banki of receiving $4.7 million in violation of the Iran sanctions. Prosecutors filed a superseding indictment  later changing the amount to $3.4 million and adding two false statement charges to the three initial charges.Banki was denied bail despite multiple attempts. He was held in high and maximum security  detention facilities pending trial. Judge John F. Keenan asserted that there was \"no combination of conditions would ensure Banki's appearance in court\" and denied bail multiple times despite securing guarantees of millions of dollars in bond. Nine attorneys and close friends volunteered to put up their homes as collateral on Banki's behalf for his bail package. But the judge did not see any monetary amount that could satisfy the bail conditions in his opinion.",
        "Trial at the District Court and forfeiture": "The indictment charging Banki argued that Banki should have gotten authorization in the form of a license for the money he received:\n\"(vi) Under the ITR, any United States person who wishes to engage in a transaction otherwise prohibited by the ITR must first file an application for a license and receive approval from OFAC. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 56.600, 560.501, and 501.801.\".Banki did not have a license for the money he received. Judge John F. Keenan denied the Banki's defense request to instruct the jury on the law that specifically permits family money as an exception to the sanctions law, permitting such transfers without the need for a license:\n\"However, U.S. depository institutions are permitted to handle funds transfers, through intermediary third-country banks, to or from Iran or for the direct or indirect benefit of the Government of Iran or a person in Iran, arising from several types of underlying transactions, including:\na) a noncommercial family remittance;\nb) an exportation to Iran or importation from Iran of information and informational materials;\nc) a travel-related remittance;\nd) a payment for the shipment of a donation of articles to relieve human suffering; or\ne) a transaction authorized by OFAC through a specific or general license.\".On May 10, 2010, a three-week trial commenced where Second Circuit District judge John F. Keenan presided. The trial concluded on June 4 when the jury returned a guilty verdict on all five counts, albeit, guilty on a lesser charge of aiding and abetting rather than running a sanctions violation money transmittal system.On June 7, 2010, despite the superseding indictment charge of $3.4 million, the same jury agreed to forfeit one bank account associated with a $6,000 transaction as the proceeds of the charges and the guilty verdict. The jury ruled that Mahmoud Reza Banki's other assets including the apartment he had purchased with the family funds he had received was not a direct proceeds of any crime and not forfeitable.\nJudge John F. Keenan overruled the jury only in the case of the forfeiture verdict on the basis that the jury might have been \"confused\" and awarded the government prosecutors a money judgment order, essentially ignoring the jury verdict on forfeiture and awarding the US Attorney's office $3.4 million, to be paid by Banki. This would have been the same as if the jury had come to the decision of full forfeiture of all of Banki's assets.\nThe defense objections throughout the trial were overruled. One such overruling was the judge's decision not to allow for jury instructions on the family money exception from the sanctions law. Essentially, the jury was not told that transfer of family money is legal; that family money can be sent to and received from Iran and is an exception in the US sanctions law against Iran. This would become a material issue at the appellate level and the primary reason for the reversal of the charges.\nJudge Keenan also did not allow the defense to call Richard Newcomb, former head of OFAC, to testify as an expert witness on the sanctions charges despite his qualifications: he had been head of OFAC for 17 years (from 1987 to 2004), where he was the author of the sanctions law. Richard Newcomb was not only the author of the underlying sanctions regulations but in his capacity as head of OFAC he had also been in charge of enforcing the sanctions law not just against Iran but all countries US had sanctions against.",
        "Sentencing and imprisonment": "During sentencing, over 120 letters of support were sent to Judge Keenan to ask for leniency. Among those were letters from Nobel Peace Laureate  Shirin Ebadi  and ex-Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Richard Newcomb.  In a lengthy letter, Richard Newcomb made the case for Banki's innocence of the sanctions charges and highlighted that through Newcomb's administration of the sanctions program in the US the program was \"never intended to target the Iranian people\" and that \"the Iranian-American community commonly and openly uses remittance forwarding service providers, including hawalas to move family funds back and forth between the United States and Iran, typically with no penalty, civil or criminal.\"On August 16, 2010, Judge Keenan sentenced Banki to 30 months in prison.Shortly after being sentenced Banki filed for appeal. The Iranian American Bar Association along with 10 other advocacy and civil rights groups filed a separate amicus brief with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The brief argued that U.S.-Iran sanctions \"are not aimed at the Iranian people, and therefore they contain exemptions permitting certain humanitarian transactions and family remittances.\"For about 11 months (from January 7, 2010, through December 1, 2010) Banki was held in high and maximum security  detention centers in Manhattan and Brooklyn (MCC and MDC). For the month of December in 2010, Banki was transferred to the Taft Correctional Institute's deportation prison outside of Bakersfield in California. In January 2011, Banki was transferred to the lower security Taft prison where he remained pending the appellate decision. Upon release Banki had served 665 days, nearly 22 months in prison.",
        "Appellate reversal": "On October 24, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  ruled in favor of Banki and reversed the sanctions charges against him. Judge Keenan's court-ordered Banki's release 10 days later on November 2, 2011.The appellate court ruled that Judge John F. Keenan had erred at trial; in denying Banki's defense request to instruct the jury on the law that specifically exempts family money as an exception to the sanctions law, permitting such transfers without the need for a license. The final appellate court brief stated: \"Banki's conviction [on the sanctions charges] cannot stand\".Prosecutors reopened the case to pursue a retrial in February 2012. However, after a few months of delay and the assignment of a new judge, the case was closed criminally with no option for future civil or criminal prosecution. Rather than pay for the high cost of a second criminal defense trial, Banki agreed to relinquish $710k of his assets. In exchange, prosecutors agreed that Banki was not guilty of the sanctions charges without going through a second trial and that they would end pursuing the case further in criminal or civil courts.\nThe case was permanently closed on July 24, 2012, with the final word being Banki's appellate win and that Banki was not guilty of the sanctions charges for which he had been arrested and for which he served 22 months in prison. In the final court hearing, Banki's prison record was cleared. During the hearing, Banki said he had lived through \"the darkest hours\" of his life while in prison. \"I watched my life pass me by. Those days will never be replaced\". Judge Engelmayer in clearing Banki's prison record called him a \"talented man, even brilliant\". The judge also stated: \". . . the damage to Mr. Banki's life brought about by his lengthy incarceration, occasioned by his confinement, cannot be measured only by the 22 months in which he lost his liberty and which he cannot get back\".",
        "Aftermath": "Since his release, Banki has completed a Masters' in Business Administration from UCLA Anderson School of Management. Banki spoke about his case for the first time publicly at a TED Conference at UCLA in 2014 in an effort to raise awareness about the justice system. He also spoke about the uncertain life path he now faces in the US and the difficulty he faces in finding employment due to his continued status as a felon despite his appellate win. There are plans for a documentary of his story.Banki's case raises questions not just about the ambiguity and impracticality of the sanctions laws for Iranian-Americans but speaks to the broader impact that the current criminal justice system can have on the path of a \"success story\".With support from 13 Congressmen and a Senator, Banki filed for a Presidential Pardon.  As of 2022, Banki was Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer at leading streaming company Tubi.   Banki was granted a full pardon on January 20, 2021."

        "Ambassador of Canada to China": "On 4 September 2019, Barton was appointed to be Ambassador to China by the Government of Canada. The appointment was met with a mixed reaction, including scrutiny around Barton's past ties with China while proponents of the appointment argued that Barton's Asian and Chinese experience made him a uniquely qualified selection.After taking on the role, Barton led Canada\u2019s efforts to win the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, two Canadians who were imprisoned in China in December, 2018, in a move widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Throughout their detention, Barton conducted regular consular visits with Kovrig and Spavor respectively, often delivering coded messages to avoid interception from eavesdropping prison guards.The Toronto Star also reported that Barton\u2019s work on this file pre-dated his appointment as Ambassador, as his network and understanding of the relevant stakeholders helped pave the way for open communication channels between Chinese, Canadian, and U.S. officials. All three countries had \u201cred lines\u201d and Barton played a leading role finding a \u201cpathway\u201d that would ultimately lead to their release.In April 2021, this included meetings in Washington where Barton received a commitment from senior U.S. officials to put intensity into their pressure on Beijing. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Barton maintained a line of communications with Xie Feng, China's Vice Foreign Minister, to coordinate the logistics of an eventual resolution that would bring the prisoner standoff to an end.On September 24, 2021, Kovrig and Spavor were released from detention in China and boarded a plane with Barton to Anchorage, Calgary, and Toronto. It was reported by Canadian media that this flight followed weeks of consecutive meetings held with Barton and Chinese officials as part of a \u201chighly choreographed\u201d effort.Barton was personally thanked by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for his role in securing the release of the two men.On December 6, 2021, it was announced that Barton would step down from the role after completing the \u201ccore mission\u201d that he had been appointed to achieve: securing the release of Kovrig and Spavor.",

The book argues that the focus of capitalism should be expanded and adapted to focus more on long-termism. Re-Imagining Capitalism builds on Barton\u2019s previous writing, which reflects on the 2008 economic crisis, rejecting the \u201cfalse choice\u201d between serving stakeholders and shareholders while advocating for long-term planning from business leaders.\nMost recently, Barton co-authored Talent Wins: The New Playbook for Putting People First, which argues that the primary driver of long-term success in companies is talent.

    "John Birt, Baron Birt": {
        "Introduction": "John Birt, Baron Birt (born 10 December 1944) is a British television executive and businessman. He is a former Director-General (1992\u20132000) of the BBC.\nAfter a successful career in commercial television, initially at Granada Television and later at London Weekend Television, Birt was appointed Deputy Director-General of the BBC in 1987 for his expertise in current affairs. The forced departure of Director-General Alasdair Milne after pressure from the Thatcher government required someone near the top, preferably from outside the BBC, with editorial and production experience (Milne had been summarily replaced by Michael Checkland, an accountant).\nDuring his tenure as Director-General, Birt restructured the BBC, in the face of much internal opposition. However, others have credited him with saving the corporation from possible government privatisation, and say he prepared for the era of digital broadcasting. After leaving the BBC, Birt was Strategic Advisor to Prime Minister Tony Blair from 2001 to 2005. \nHe was appointed Chairman of CPA Global in 2015.",
        "Early life and commercial television career": "Birt was born in Liverpool to a Catholic father, a manager at the Firestone tyre company, and a Protestant mother. He was raised as a Catholic, and educated at the direct-grant grammar school St. Mary's College, Crosby, near Liverpool and read engineering at St Catherine's College, Oxford, graduating from Oxford University with a third-class degree in engineering.\nFrom 1966 to 1971, Birt worked for Granada Television, where he devised and produced the magazine programme Nice Time before joining Granada's World in Action current affairs series. Birt persuaded Mick Jagger, who had just spent three nights in Brixton prison for possession of drugs, to participate in a 1967 edition of World in Action in which Jagger conversed with the editor of The Times (William Rees-Mogg) and the Bishop of Woolwich (John A. T. Robinson), among others. It was hailed as a \"dialogue between generations.\" With Gus Macdonald, Birt became joint editor of World in Action in 1969.\nBirt moved from Granada to London Weekend Television in 1971. At LWT he was the founding editor and executive producer of the current affairs programme Weekend World. He became head of current affairs at LWT and, later, controller of features and current affairs. With Weekend World presenter Peter Jay, Birt contributed a series of three articles to The Times on the topic of television journalism. They argued that most television news and current affairs contained a \"bias against understanding\": pictures had taken precedence over analysis. Instead they advocated \"a mission to explain\". Makers of news and documentary programmes were required to outline their finished product in writing before setting out with a camera crew. Such an argument, was not universally accepted. Years later, in 2006, Alasdair Milne, the former BBC Director-General, said he thought Birt's \"bias against understanding\" argument was nonsense.In the mid-1970s, he took a break from LWT to produce David Frost's The Nixon Interviews with the disgraced former US President Richard Nixon. In the 1977 interviews, watched by 45 million people, Nixon admitted his part in the scandal which had led to his resignation.Birt returned to LWT as director of programmes in 1982. During this period he revived the career of his old friend, the Liverpool singer Cilla Black, who in due course became the highest-paid female performer on UK television. Birt formed a close working relationship with his boss at LWT, Michael Grade, although this would later sour when both were working at the BBC.",
        "BBC career": "Birt's success at LWT prompted the BBC's governors to appoint him Deputy Director-General in 1987 under Michael Checkland. Birt also served as the BBC's director of news and current affairs at this time.\nBirt's promotion to Director-General in 1992 caused controversy when it was revealed he was employed on a freelance consultancy basis. Under political and public pressure, Birt became a BBC employee. He had to sell his shares in LWT, losing out on a windfall of what would have been several million pounds when it was bought by Granada in 1994. The Sunday Times later revealed that Birt had been a member of the Labour Party at the time of his appointment, a concern to Conservatives who had already expressed concerns about alleged left-wing bias at the organisation.As Director-General, Birt was tasked with securing the BBC's future at a time of rapid technical, cultural and economic changes in world broadcasting. In seven years, Birt restructured and modernised the corporation which he wanted to make \"the best managed public sector organisation\". Birt imposed a policy of radical change to deliver efficiency savings. In April 1993 he introduced Producer Choice, giving programme makers the power to buy services from outside the BBC. This theoretically reduced the cost to licence-payers of the BBC's historic resource base. Faced with high rental fees from the BBC's record library, producers found it cheaper to buy records from local record shops. In-house facilities were closed or stood idle, allegedly as a result of Birt's \"creative accounting\" methods.\nAbove all, Birt is credited with preparing the organisation for the new landscape shaped by digitalisation \u2013 preparations that were \"far in advance of the BBC\u2019s terrestrial rivals\", according to the academic Georgina Born. At the 1996 Edinburgh Television Festival, Birt said that without the resources to prepare for the digital age, the BBC would be \"history\". Birt asserted that the changes made the BBC more agile, more competitive and allowed it to expand beyond its traditional broadcasting services, but remaining licence-fee funded. He was one of the driving forces behind the launch of continuous news output and he took much money from traditional services to fund the 24-hour news channel and advance on the internet. However, such ventures were criticised by many as being clearly detrimental to BBC core programming.Birt has argued that without his changes, the BBC's operating charter might not have been renewed in the 1990s. Birt's advocates include the journalists John Lloyd, John Simpson and Polly Toynbee. Birt's use of impenetrable jargon became known as \"Birtspeak\", a phenomenon mocked in the satirical magazine Private Eye, complete with a miniature Dalek caricature of Birt. The comparison originated from playwright Dennis Potter, who labeled Birt a \"croak-voiced Dalek\" in his MacTaggart Lecture delivered in August 1993 at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. The BBC's post-production department made a Christmas tape casting Birt as Davros, the head of the Daleks, which was alluded to many years later on a BBC DVD commentary for Genesis of the Daleks by former director David Maloney. Journalist Mark Lawson wrote at the time that Potter's \"tendency towards unfocused vitriol and noisy self-examination made his contribution easily swattable by the BBC's damage controllers\". Birt himself did not agree with his critics' portrait of the BBC of the time, but did allow that drama was a source of concern. \"The originality is not there as it was in the Sixties\", he said.One of Birt's predecessors, Alasdair Milne, said Birt did little good for the BBC apart from establishing its internet service and criticised him for paying consultants large fees for the corporation's restructuring. Many others opposed Birt, his methods and his reforms, including the journalists John Tusa, Mark Tully and Charles Wheeler, and news correspondent Kate Adie. Radio broadcaster John Dunn believed morale was bad under Birt, while David Attenborough commented that producers spend too much time worrying about money as a result of Birt's reforms.Birt's arrival at the BBC hastened the departure of executive Bill Cotton, who described his tenure as a \"nightmare\" for the BBC. Marmaduke Hussey, who appointed Birt to his BBC role, later claimed to have regrets. Some of Birt's changes were partially dismantled by his successors Greg Dyke and Mark Thompson. However, producer Tony Garnett claimed in 2009 that Birt's legacy of \"totalitarian micro management\" has existed at the BBC ever since.In 1998, Birt imposed a ban on BBC output mentioning the private life of Peter Mandelson. This order followed an edition of Newsnight, during which Matthew Parris had said that Mandelson was homosexual. Peter Ainsworth, the Conservative shadow Culture Secretary, questioned whether this was a generic ban on mentioning private issues or specific to Mandelson.Birt was succeeded as Director-General by Greg Dyke who also had ties to the Labour Party.",
        "Post-BBC career": "No information",
        "Advisor to Tony Blair": "Birt was brought into Number 10 to lead the development of long-term strategy for the government on key areas of public policy. Tony Blair asked him to produce a report on solutions to crime, and he served as advisor on Criminal Justice from 2000 to 2001. The establishment of a Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was an idea originally conceived by Birt.Birt was made unpaid Strategy Adviser to Blair in 2001, appointed for what was termed \"blue skies thinking\" and claimed by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to be \"worth every penny\"; Blair wanted advice from outside the traditional Whitehall mindset \u2013 he had known Birt since the 1980s and approved of his analytical approach. Jeremy Heywood, Blair's principal private secretary, said: \"He liked the way that John was willing to get right down into the data and understand the evidence, and come up with a real sense that you could do things in a totally different way.\" Birt supervised the development of long-term strategy on drugs, health, crime reduction, education, transport and London. His 2004 report on drug policy recommended making heroin use a criminal offence on par with possession.However, Birt's recommendations made him unpopular with some ministers and Blair's decision to ask Birt for a \"private\" report on crime irritated Jack Straw and the Home Office. In 2002, he proposed a second network of motorways operated as tolls to counter the problems of traffic congestion.Many saw Birt's role in government as controversial, since as a special advisor, rather than a civil servant, he was not formally obliged to face questions from House of Commons select committees. In October 2002 it emerged that the government had specifically asked him not to appear in front of the transport select committee, at a time when he was in charge of long-term transport strategy.\nBlair asked Birt to help him define his main domestic policy priorities so he could develop precise plans for the period after the 2005 election. Birt had first proposed the idea of the \"five-year plans\" in 2003 and was now responsible for overseeing the Third Term Plan. This included the overall policy programme, machinery of government changes and the legislative timetable. A special project team to develop the third term was led by Birt and Turnbull and reported regularly to the prime minister. Birt's team produced detailed proposals with a precise grid on how to implement policy.\nConcurrently, Birt served as an advisor at McKinsey & Company's Global Media Practice from 2000 to 2005. His relationship with government and McKinsey caused some controversy as McKinsey were increasingly working with UK government departments in a range of public service and defence areas. Birt remained at Number 10 as an unpaid adviser until December 2005, when he left to join private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners as an adviser.\nThe Financial Times reported at the beginning of July 2005 that Birt's office ceiling at No 10 Downing Street had fallen in. However, Birt was not injured.",
        "Later business career": "From 2006 to 2010, he was an adviser for consulting firm Capgemini on strategic issues, with a focus on the public sector and its Telecom, Media and Entertainment practice. Birt served as chairman of Lynx New Media (subsequently Lynx Capital Ventures) from 2000 to 2004. He was chairman of Waste Recycling Group and subsequently non-executive director of Infinis, a generator of renewable power. He also served chairman of Maltby Capital from 2007 to 2010.Birt was chairman of PayPal Europe between 2010 and 2014, having joined the board in 2004.

        "Honours and awards": "Birt received an Emmy in 1995, for his \"outstanding contribution\" to international television.Birt was awarded a knighthood, and on 11 February 2000 he was created a life peer as Baron Birt, of Liverpool in the County of Merseyside. He took his seat in the House of Lords in March 2000 as a crossbencher.",
        "Crossbencher in the House of Lords": "Birt is an active cross-bencher in the House of Lords, speaking out in 2011 and 2012 in favour of government's proposed Health and Social Care Bill. Birt's special interests include the Media/ Broadcasting/ Communications Industry, Climate Change/ Environment, Criminal Justice and EducationIn 2013 Birt voiced his opinion to the House of Lords about his views on the Gay Marriage bill stating \u2018this bill goes the whole hog and rightly allows gay couples, if they wish, to make the powerful statements of love and commitment that marriage proclaims. If gay couples want that option, they should have it.\u2019In 2014 Birt showed his support for the assisted dying legislation, in the House of Lords debate, in which participants were evenly split. Before the 2014 Scottish referendum, Bird argued that Scottish independence would have a devastating impact on the BBC. \n In 2015, he led criticism of the decision for the BBC to start funding TV licences for over-75s, calling it a 'deeply shocking announcement'.",
        "Later reflections on broadcasting career": "Returning to his earlier career on 26 August 2005, Birt delivered his second MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. Partly a review of his professional life as a broadcaster, he also criticised the \"tabloidisation\" of intellectual concerns. More importantly, he argued that Channel 4 should receive financial help, in order to preserve \"public service broadcasting\", which was taken as advocacy of the BBC sharing its licence fee with Channel Four, so called \"top slicing\". He also mentioned that his long-standing feud with Michael Grade had been resolved, but the speech as a whole was not admired by many figures in the industry.Following Director-General George Entwistle's resignation in November 2012, James Purnell argued that the new Director-General \"should learn from the Birt era\" stating that it was Birt's \"boldness\" that saved the BBC. Instead of playing it safe and avoiding mistakes, he said, Birt transformed output and embraced the internet, and rebuilt relationships with government, business and the public. Media commentator Steve Hewlett, Birt's former colleague and friend, suggested in 2012 that it might be time for the BBC \"to bring in Birt 2.0\". Hewlett acknowledged that many of Birt's reforms were unpopular, but said that without them, \"it is questionable whether the BBC would exist in anything like its present capable and competitive form, or indeed would have retained the huge affection of audiences\".",

    "Marvin Bower": {
        "Introduction": "Marvin Bower (August 1, 1903 \u2013 January 22, 2003) was an American business theorist and management consultant associated with McKinsey & Company. Under Bower's leadership, McKinsey grew from a small engineering and accounting firm to a leader in the consulting industry. Bower, alongside Edwin G. Booz, is regarded one of the individuals most responsible for the rise of management consulting after World War II; he is considered by many to be the \"father\" of the modern consulting industry.\"",
        "Biography": "Bower was the son of the deputy recorder at Cuyahoga County, and grew up in the Collinwood neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio and attended Glenville High School. He earned his bachelor's degree in Economics and Psychology from Brown University in 1925. His father advised him to study law, and Bower graduated from Harvard Law School in 1928. Bower then attended Harvard Business School, graduating in 1930. Following completion of his studies, Bower worked as an associate at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Cleveland.\nIn 1933, Bower was hired by James O. McKinsey in the new Chicago firm of James O. McKinsey & Company to manage a newly acquired branch in New York. Following McKinsey's death in 1937, the two offices split up and Bower resurrected the New York firm, with the assistance of New York partners, as McKinsey & Company in 1939. He served as managing director from 1950 to 1967, and remained a leadership figure at McKinsey as director and partner until 1992.\nAccording to Harvard Business School, Bower \"is considered the father of modern management consulting\" for his decades of work at McKinsey. Upon turning 60 years old, Bower sold his shares back to the firm at book value. This was an unusual step, as the book value of the shares was likely well below that of their market value.\nBower's decision came as a surprise to many, including his family. \"Let me just say there was a shock on people's faces when he told us that he was selling his shares back to McKinsey at book value,\" said his son Dick Bower. \"It felt unbelievable, to tell you the truth. But that was Marvin for you.\"Bower is widely credited for leading the formation of the global management consulting industry. His principled insistence on impeccable professional standards in substance, ethics, and style; his dedication to the professional development of his colleagues; and his candor, all served as a role model for several generations of management consultants, both within and outside McKinsey. He protested being named one by BusinessWeek as one of the top businesspeople of the 20th century on the grounds that he was a professional, not a businessman.",

Brittin and Google were accused by the committee, of being \"evil\" for not paying its \"fair amount of tax\".Brittin was called repeatedly to the committee, and claimed that Google does not \"sell\" in the UK, even though UK staff are paid incentives to \"encourage\" potential customers to spend money with Google. Reports from former staff contradicted his statements. He did not clarify his definition of \"selling\", but he \"... admitted \u2019sales\u2019 staff based in Britain are paid commission for reaching targets, further contradicting his statement. It was also revealed that Google often advertised UK-based 'sales' jobs.\"In 2015, the UK Government introduced a new law intended to penalise Google and other large multinational corporations' artificial tax avoidance.On 11 February 2016, in response to the committee asking how much he earned, Brittin claimed he did not know how much he was paid, a response that was widely ridiculed.

        "Career": "No information",
        "Early career and the Clinton White House": "Mathews began her career in 1990 as an associate at the New York consulting firm McKinsey & Company. In 1992, Mathews joined the Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign and led the economic team for the president-elect. Following Clinton's inauguration, Mathews, with Robert Rubin, helped establish the National Economic Council (NEC). She served as staff director of the NEC from 1993 to 1995. While Mathews was at NEC, the White House pushed for healthcare reform. Mathews was among those in the administration who advocated for finding ways, apart from legislation, to curb healthcare costs.When Rubin became secretary of the treasury in 1995, Mathews became his chief of staff. She testified before a Senate committee during the Whitewater investigations regarding her search of Vince Foster's garbage and the fate of the documents she discovered. Mathews told the committee she had been looking for an indication as to why Foster had committed suicide and denied ordering any documents destroyed.In 1997 Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles recruited Mathews for deputy chief of staff after being impressed with her intelligence during an Oval Office meeting. Mathews became one of two deputy chiefs of staff, serving alongside John Podesta.

Mathews remained at OMB for the remainder of Clinton's presidency during a time of three budget surpluses.",
        "Charitable foundations and other private sector activities": "In 2001 Mathews relocated to Seattle, Washington, to work for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest philanthropic organization in the United States, as an executive vice president. The following year, she became chief operating officer of the Foundation. The Foundation reorganized in 2006, naming Mathews president of the foundation's Global Development Program. Mathews was involved in awarding grants to improve health outcomes in the developing world, including stopping the spread of HIV and other diseases and making contraception more readily available.She served on the board of the University of Washington Medical Center from 2002 to 2005. During that time, the board oversaw an upgrade to the medical center's electronic medical records and system for tracking patient outcomes.

Burwell relocated to Bentonville, Arkansas, for the position.",
        "Office of Management and Budget Director": "On March 3, 2013, President Barack Obama nominated Burwell to be the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. A confirmation hearing was held on April 10. Burwell's nomination received bipartisan support, culminating in the U.S. Senate confirming Burwell as Director by a 96\u20130 vote. With her confirmation, Burwell became only the second woman to serve as OMB Director, the first being Alice Rivlin, who held the position from 1994 to 1996.Burwell entered the job at a time when conservatives wanted to decrease spending and defund Obama's signature healthcare legislation, the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Although Congress tried to negotiate a continuing resolution to fund the government pending negotiation of the larger budget, it became clear on September 30, 2013, that no temporary agreement would be reached. Without an agreed-upon budget from Congress, Burwell as Director was tasked with initiating a federal government shutdown, the first U.S. federal government shutdown in 17 years. Burwell sent a memo advising agencies and executive departments to shut down, including the closing of national parks, visitors' centers, and even the \"panda-cam\" at the National Zoo. The shutdown lasted 16 days. Once the government reopened, Burwell helped negotiate a two-year budget deal to avoid future shutdowns.",
        "Health and Human Services secretary": "On April 11, 2014, Obama nominated Burwell to be the next secretary of health and human services, succeeding Kathleen Sebelius, who had announced her resignation the day before. At the time of her nomination, Obama praised Burwell as a \"proven manager and she knows how to deliver results.\" The Senate confirmed Burwell as Secretary on June 5, 2014, by a vote of 78\u201317. She was sworn into office on June 9, 2014.

At the end of her tenure, Burwell received praise from Democratic and Republican senators.",
        "Ebola epidemic response": "With an Ebola epidemic devastating West Africa, Burwell began holding daily meetings on July 28, 2014, as part of the efforts of the United States government, including the Department of HHS, to prevent the further spread of the disease. Starting on September 30, other Obama administration officials began giving daily public briefings while Burwell took less of a public role, although she did take part in a number of public meetings. In the fall of 2014, the first known death from Ebola in the United States occurred. The Obama administration proposed devoting $6 billion to fight the spread of Ebola, including $2 billion for the State Department and USAID. The plan included provisions to help U.S. hospitals become better prepared and to support global health initiatives aimed at containing the disease in Africa. Congress allocated $5.4 billion to fight Ebola in response to the Obama administration request. Burwell and other Obama administration officials sought to assure the public that the American health system was prepared to deal with Ebola cases and that the chances of a full outbreak in the United States were low.",
        "Zika response": "In February 2016, in response to the spread of the Zika virus, the Obama administration requested that Congress appropriate $1.9 billion to fight the spread of the disease. Congress did not initially take action, leaving Burwell to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram $589 million in funds previously designated as part of the response to Ebola, to fight the spread of the Zika virus.Of the initial Zika funding, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) received $222 million to lead the domestic fight against the virus with the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority splitting $152 million for the domestic effort. In response to Congressional complaints that the money was not being spent fast enough, Burwell informed Congress that without further funding, the CDC would deplete its budget to fight Zika by September 30, 2016. After Burwell moved funding from other HHS programs, Congress finally appropriated $1.1 billion to fight the spread of Zika in the United States. By the end of September 2016, the United States reported 23,000 cases in the territory of Puerto Rico, 3,000 cases in the states, and 21 babies born in the United States with microcephaly testing positive for Zika.",
        "The Affordable Care Act": "Burwell's tenure as HHS secretary began ahead of the Affordable Care Act's second open-enrollment period for healthcare insurance in November 2014. In preparation for the enrollment period, Burwell hired additional staff to coordinate operations. The first open-enrollment period, which had occurred during Secretary Sebelius' tenure, was marred by technical difficulties with the Healthcare.gov website. In preparation for the second enrollment period, the HealthCare.gov website underwent various testing actions. The Secretary noted the website had been reconfigured, reducing the number of screens from over seventy to just over a dozen website pages to make the application process smoother.Because of her position as Secretary of HHS, Burwell was the named party in multiple lawsuits related to the Affordable Care Act. One month into her tenure, the Supreme Court decided Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, where the court struck down the implementation of the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate as violating Hobby Lobby's religious freedom. The Supreme Court also decided King v. Burwell, a case in which the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act's subsidies for healthcare plans purchased on federal exchanges.In July 2016, ahead of the 2016 elections, Burwell began touring, giving speeches on the success of the Affordable Care Act and its potential for the future. The election resulted in Republicans winning control of the Presidency and Congress, having campaigned to repeal the law. Burwell continued to advocate for the Affordable Care Act, arguing it was \"woven into the fabric of our nation\". Since its inception, the law had led to coverage for 20 million more people, and Burwell argued the complexity of the law meant that repealing any part would have effects throughout the healthcare system. Burwell and the Department of HHS devised the \"Coverage Matters\" campaign to increase public support for the law and to boost enrollment.",
        "American University": "Less than a week after leaving her position as HHS secretary, American University announced Burwell would serve as the university's next president, its school's highest leadership position despite not having earned a masters or doctoral degree. Burwell began her tenure on June 1, 2017, becoming American's 15th president and the first woman to assume the role.In 2020, Burwell was appointed by the Council on Foreign Relations to co-chair (alongside Frances Townsend) the Independent Task Force on Improving Pandemic Preparedness.",

        "Introduction": "Peter Paul Montgomery Buttigieg ( BOOT-\u0259-j\u0259j; born January 19, 1982) is an American politician and former military officer who is currently serving as the 19th United States secretary of transportation. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the 32nd mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from 2012 to 2020, which earned him the nickname \"Mayor Pete\".\nButtigieg is a graduate of Harvard College and the University of Oxford, attending the latter on a Rhodes Scholarship. From 2009 to 2017, he was an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve, attaining the rank of lieutenant. He was mobilized and deployed to the War in Afghanistan for seven months in 2014. Before being elected as mayor of South Bend in 2011, Buttigieg worked on the political campaigns of Democrats Jill Long Thompson, Joe Donnelly, and John Kerry, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic nominee for Indiana state treasurer in 2010. While serving as South Bend's mayor, Buttigieg came out as gay in 2015. He married Chasten Glezman, a schoolteacher and writer, in June 2018. Buttigieg declined to seek a third term as mayor.\nButtigieg ran as a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, launching his campaign for the 2020 United States presidential election on April 14, 2019. He became one of the first openly gay men to launch a major party presidential campaign. Despite initially low expectations, he gained significant momentum in mid-2019 when he participated in several town hall meetings and television debates. Buttigieg narrowly won the Iowa caucuses and placed a close second in the New Hampshire primary. By winning Iowa, he became the first openly gay candidate to win a presidential primary or caucus. Buttigieg dropped out of the race on March 1, 2020, and endorsed Joe Biden the following day.\nPresident-elect Biden named Buttigieg as his nominee for Secretary of Transportation in December 2020. His nomination was confirmed on February 2, 2021, by a vote of 86\u201313, making him the first openly gay Cabinet secretary in U.S. history. Nominated at age 38, he is also the youngest Cabinet member in the Biden administration and the youngest person ever to serve as Secretary of Transportation.",
        "Early life and career": "Pete Buttigieg, the only child of Jennifer Anne (Montgomery) and Joseph Anthony Buttigieg II, was born on January 19, 1982, in South Bend, Indiana. His mother uses the name Anne Montgomery. His parents met and married while employed as faculty at New Mexico State University. His father was born in Hamrun, Malta, and emigrated to the United States to pursue his doctorate. Buttigieg's father embarked on a career as a professor of English at the University of Notre Dame near South Bend. Buttigieg's mother also taught at the University of Notre Dame for 29 years. His father was a translator and editor of the three-volume English edition of Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci's Prison Notebooks and influenced his pursuit of literature in college.",
        "Education": "Buttigieg's education plan includes a $700 billion investment in universal full-day child care and pre-kindergarten for all children from infancy to age five. Buttigieg has also proposed tripling Title I funding for schools serving students predominately from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Other goals include doubling the amount of new teachers of color in the next 10 years, addressing school segregation with a $500 million fund, paying teachers more, expanding mental health services in schools, and creating more after-school programs and summer learning opportunities.His plan for debt-free college has called for expanding Pell Grants for low-income students, as well as other investments and reversing Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy. Under Buttigieg's college plan, the bottom 80 percent of students with respect to income would have received free education, while the top 20 percent would have paid for at least some portion of their tuition. Buttigieg has opposed free college tuition for all students because he has believed universally free tuition unfairly subsidizes higher-income families at the expense of lower-income individuals who do not attend college. This position distinguished Buttigieg from his competitors in the 2020 presidential election.",

His clients at McKinsey included the health insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, electronics retailer Best Buy, Canadian supermarket chain Loblaws, two nonprofit environmentalist groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Energy Foundation, and several U.S. government agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Energy Department, Defense Department, and Postal Service. He took a leave of absence from McKinsey in 2008 to become research director for Jill Long Thompson's unsuccessful campaign for Indiana governor. His work at McKinsey included trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, which he rarely discusses. Buttigieg left McKinsey in 2010 in order to focus full-time on his campaign for Indiana state treasurer.Buttigieg has been involved with the Truman National Security Project since 2005 and serves as a fellow with expertise in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He was named to the organization's board of advisors in 2014.",
        "Military service": "Buttigieg joined the U.S. Navy Reserve through the direct commission officer (DCO) program and was sworn in as an ensign in naval intelligence in September 2009. He took a seven-month leave during his mayoral term to deploy to Afghanistan in 2014. While there, Buttigieg was part of a unit assigned to identify and disrupt terrorist finance networks. Part of this was done at Bagram Air Base, but he was also an armed driver for his commander on more than 100 trips into Kabul. Buttigieg has jokingly referred to his role as an armed driver as \"military Uber\", because he had to watch out for ambushes and explosive devices along the roads and ensure that the vehicle was guarded. Also, while deployed in Afghanistan, Buttigieg was assigned to the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, a counterterrorism unit that targeted Taliban insurgency financing. Buttigieg was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal, and he left the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2017.",
        "Indiana state treasurer election": "Buttigieg was the Democratic nominee for state treasurer of Indiana in 2010. He received 37.5 percent of the vote, losing to Republican incumbent Richard Mourdock. Much of Buttigieg's campaign had focused on criticizing Mourdock for investing state pension funds in Chrysler junk bonds, and for having subsequently filed a lawsuit against Chrysler's bankruptcy restructuring, which Buttigieg argued imperiled Chrysler jobs in the state of Indiana.",
        "Mayor of South Bend": "No information",
        "First term": "Shortly after losing the 2010 Indiana State Treasurer election, Buttigieg ran for the Democratic nomination for mayor of South Bend in 2011. In a PBS Michiana \u2013 WNIT broadcast, he expressed his desire to reinvigorate South Bend, especially with respect to job creation and education. Buttigieg campaigned on other issues, such as pursuing international investment, increasing presence of police and other safety professionals, and improving city services. Buttigieg won his primary election against four opponents on May 3, 2011, receiving 7,663 votes.\nButtigieg was elected mayor of South Bend in the November 2011 general election with 10,991 of the 14,883 votes cast, or 74 percent of all votes. He defeated Republican nominee Norris W. Curry Jr. and Libertarian nominee Patrick M. Farrell. Buttigieg took office in January 2012 at the age of 29, becoming the second-youngest mayor in South Bend history and the youngest incumbent mayor, at the time, of a U.S. city with at least 100,000 residents.Before Buttigieg took office, Jiha'd Vasquez, a 16-year-old black boy, was found hanging from an electrical tower on April 14, 2011. Vasquez's backpack, on the ground near his body, had several items missing, according to Vasquez's mother Stephanie Jones. The coroner, Chuck Hurley, who had no medical experience, claimed Vasquez's death was a suicide; Buttigieg later appointed Hurley to serve as interim police chief. Vasquez's body was cremated without an autopsy being conducted. Jones attempted to get Buttigieg to investigate her son's death, but he did not, fearing \"potential political risks.\" According to Jones, Buttigieg told her to call his office, but she never got a response. Jones and South Bend NAACP legal redress chairman Tom Bush claimed the event was a cover-up, with Bush saying he suspected the Ku Klux Klan may be involved and hoped for a federal investigation, but did not expect it, saying \"the only reason this will get done is if you\u2019re on a microphone yelling and screaming.\" When Buttigieg's presidential campaign was asked about the incident by a reporter in 2019, they did not give a response. In 2019, Jones and St. Joseph County coroner Mike McGann argued that the case should be reopened; however, sheriff William Redman said he would not consider reopening the case unless further evidence came to light.After a federal investigation ruled that South Bend police had illegally recorded telephone calls of several officers, Buttigieg demoted police chief Darryl Boykins in 2012. Buttigieg also dismissed the department's communications director, who had discovered the recordings but continued to record the line at Boykins's command. The police communications director alleged that the recordings captured four senior police officers making racist remarks and discussing illegal acts.Buttigieg has written that his \"first serious mistake as mayor\" came shortly after taking office in 2012, when he decided to ask for Boykins's resignation. Backed by supporters and legal counsel, Boykins requested reinstatement. When Buttigieg denied his request, Boykins, as the city's first African-American police chief, sued the city for racial discrimination, arguing that the taping policy had existed under previous police chiefs, who were white. Buttigieg settled the lawsuits brought by Boykins and the four officers out of court for over $800,000. A federal judge ruled in 2015 that Boykins's recordings violated the Federal Wiretap Act. Buttigieg came under pressure from political opponents to release the eight tapes, but he said that it was not possible to release seven of them, citing the Federal Wiretap Act. It was unclear if releasing the eighth tape would violate any laws. St. Joseph County Superior Court Judge Steve Hostetler heard a case for the release of five cassette tapes. Judge Hostetler ruled that the cassette tapes must be released to the South Bend City Council in May 2021.As mayor, Buttigieg promoted a number of development and redevelopment projects. Buttigieg was a leading figure behind the creation of a nightly laser-light display along downtown South Bend's St. Joseph River trail as public art. The project cost $700,000, which was raised from private funds. The \"River Lights\" installation was unveiled in May 2015 as part of the city's 150th anniversary celebrations. He also oversaw the city's launching of a 3-1-1 system in 2013. Buttigieg's administration oversaw the sale of numerous city-owned properties. One of Buttigieg's signature programs was the \"Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative\". Known locally as 1,000 Properties in 1,000 Days, it was a project to repair or demolish blighted properties across South Bend. The program reached its goal two months before its scheduled end date in November 2015. By the thousandth day of the program, before Buttigieg's first term ended, nearly 40 percent of the targeted houses were repaired, and 679 were demolished or under contract for demolition. Buttigieg took note of the fact that many homes within communities of color were the ones demolished, leading to early distrust between the city and these communities.While mayor, Buttigieg served for seven months in Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve, returning to the United States on September 23, 2014. In his absence, Deputy Mayor Mark Neal, South Bend's city comptroller, served as executive from February 2014 until Buttigieg returned to his role as mayor in October 2014.In 2015, during the controversy over Indiana Senate Bill 101 \u2013 the original version of which was widely criticized for allowing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people \u2013 Buttigieg emerged as a leading opponent of the legislation. Amid his reelection campaign, he came out as gay and expressed his solidarity with the LGBTQ community.",
        "Second term": "Buttigieg announced in 2014 that he would seek a second term in 2015. He won the Democratic primary with approximately 78 percent of the vote, defeating Henry Davis Jr., the city councilman from the second district. In November 2015, he was elected to his second term as mayor with over 80 percent of the vote, defeating Republican Kelly Jones by a margin of 8,515 to 2,074 votes. After winning reelection, Buttigieg signed an executive order helping to establish a recognized city identification card in 2016.To improve South Bend's downtown area, Buttigieg proposed a Smart Streets urban development program in 2013. In early 2015 \u2013 after traffic studies and public hearings \u2013 he secured a bond issue for the program backed by tax increment financing. Smart Streets was a complete streets implementation program aimed at improving economic development and urban vibrancy as well as road safety. Elements of the project were finished in 2016, and was officially completed in 2017. The project was credited with spurring private development in the city.In a new phase of the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative, South Bend partnered with the Notre Dame Clinical Law Center to provide free legal assistance to qualifying applicants wishing to acquire vacant lots and, with local nonprofits, to repair or construct homes and provide low-income home ownership assistance using South Bend Housing and Urban Development funds.\n\nThe City of South Bend partnered with the State of Indiana and private developers to break ground on a $165 million renovation of the former Studebaker complex in 2016, hoping that the redevelopment would facilitate industrial and housing units. This development is in the Renaissance District, which includes nearby Ignition Park. In 2017, it was announced that the long-abandoned Studebaker Building 84, also known as Ivy Tower, would have its exterior renovated with $3.5 million in Regional Cities funds from the State of Indiana and another $3.5 million from South Bend tax increment financing, with plans for the building and other structures in its complex to serve as a technology hub. The website Best Cities later ranked South Bend number 39 on its 2020 list of the 100 best small cities in the United States, citing Buttigieg's efforts to revitalize the Studebaker factory and Downtown South Bend.Under Buttigieg, the city also began a smart sewer program, the first phase of which was finished in 2017 at a cost of $150 million. The effort used federal funds and by 2019 had reduced the combined sewer overflow by 75 percent. The impetus for the effort was a fine that the EPA had levied against the city in 2011 for Clean Water Act violations. In 2019, Buttigieg asked for the city to be released from an agreement with the EPA brokered under his mayoral predecessor Steve Luecke, in which South Bend had agreed to make hundreds of millions dollars in further improvements to its sewer system by 2031.The Common Council approved Buttigieg's request to enable his administration to develop a city climate plan in April 2019; Buttigieg signed a contract with the Chicago firm Delta Institute to help develop it. In late November 2019, the city's Common Council voted 7\u20130 to approve the resultant Carbon Neutral 2050 plan, setting the goal of meeting the Paris Agreement's 26 percent emission reduction by 2025, and aiming for a further reductions of 45 percent by 2035.Supporting private development in South Bend was another initiative Buttigieg continued during his second term. By 2019, the city had seen $374 million in private investment for mixed-use developments since Buttigieg had taken office, by one estimate. By another account, Downtown South Bend saw roughly $200 million in private investment during Buttigieg's tenure.\n\nWith respect to infrastructure, Buttigieg promoted the idea of moving the city's South Shore Line station from South Bend International Airport to the city's downtown in August 2018. He made it a goal to have the city complete this project by 2025. Also, South Bend launched Commuters Trust, a new transportation benefit program created in collaboration with local employers and transportation providers, including South Bend Transpo and Lyft, in 2019. The program was made possible by a $1 million three-year grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge. Furthermore, under Buttigieg, South Bend invested $50 million in the city's parks, many of which had been neglected during the preceding decades.\n\nAfter a white South Bend police officer shot and killed Eric Logan, an African-American man, in June 2019, Buttigieg was drawn from his presidential campaign to focus on the emerging public reaction. Police body cameras were not turned on during Logan's death. Soon after Logan's death, Buttigieg presided over a town hall meeting attended by disaffected activists from the African-American community as well as relatives of the deceased man. The local police union accused Buttigieg of making decisions for political gain. Buttigieg secured $180,000 in November 2019 to commission a review of South Bend's police department policies and practices, to be conducted by Chicago-based consulting firm 21CP Solutions.Many African-Americans have accused Buttigieg of racism for his response to this and other incidents. Former South Bend councilman Henry Davis Jr. alleged that Buttigieg \"perpetuated and tolerated\" systemic racism in the city. Michael Harriot, senior writer at The Root, accused Buttigieg of \"racist paternalism\" for saying that children of color lack role models that promote the value of education. Many African-Americans also point to Buttigieg's firing of Darryl Boykins, South Bend's first black chief of police. Boykins claimed that Buttigieg used a scandal\u2014involving secret tapes of white police officers making racist comments\u2014as a pretext for firing him.",
        "Increased national profile": "In the 2016 U.S. Senate election in Indiana, he campaigned on behalf of Democratic Senate nominee Evan Bayh and criticized Bayh's opponent, Todd Young, for having voiced support in 2010 for retaining the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, which Bayh had voted to repeal. In the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, Buttigieg endorsed Hillary Clinton. He also endorsed Democratic nominee Lynn Coleman in that year's election for Indiana's 2nd congressional district, which included South Bend.Frank Bruni of The New York Times published a 2016 column praising Buttigieg's work as mayor, with a headline asking if he might be \"the first gay president\". Barack Obama cited him as one of the Democratic Party's talents in a November 2016 profile on the outgoing president conducted by The New Yorker. As Buttigieg's national profile grew following his run in the 2017 Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, Buttigieg increased his out-of-city travel. By early 2018, there was speculation that Buttigieg would run for either governor or president in 2020.For the 2018 midterms, Buttigieg founded the political action committee (PAC) Hitting Home PAC. That October, Buttigieg personally endorsed 21 congressional candidates. He also later endorsed Mel Hall, Democratic nominee in the 2018 election for Indiana's 2nd congressional district. Buttigieg campaigned for Joe Donnelly's reelection campaign in the United States Senate election in Indiana. Buttigieg campaigned for candidates in more than a dozen states, including early presidential primary states such as Iowa and South Carolina, a move indicating potential interest in running for president. He officially announced his run on January 23, 2019.",
        "Succession as mayor": "Buttigieg announced that he would not seek a third term as mayor of South Bend in December 2018. Buttigieg endorsed James Mueller in the 2019 South Bend mayoral election. Mueller was a high-school classmate of Buttigieg's and his mayoral chief of staff, and later executive director of the South Bend Department of Community Investment. Mueller's campaign promised to continue the progress that had been made under Buttigieg's mayoralty. Buttigieg appeared in campaign advertisements for Mueller and donated to Mueller's campaign. Mueller won the May 2019 Democratic primary with 37 percent of the vote in a crowded field. In the November 2019 general election, Mueller defeated Republican nominee Sean M. Haas with 63 percent of the vote. Mueller took office on New Year's Day 2020.",
        "DNC chairmanship campaign": "In January 2017, Buttigieg announced his candidacy for chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in its 2017 chairmanship election. He built a national profile as an emerging dark horse in the race for the chairmanship with the backing of former DNC chairman Howard Dean, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, Indiana senator Joe Donnelly, and North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp. Buttigieg campaigned on the need for the Democratic Party to empower its millennial members.Former U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez and U.S. representative Keith Ellison quickly emerged as the favored candidates of a majority of DNC members. Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election without endorsing a candidate, and Perez was elected chairman after two rounds of voting.",
        "2020 presidential campaign": "On January 23, 2019, Buttigieg announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the upcoming 2020 election. Buttigieg sought the Democratic Party nomination for president. If he had been elected, he would have been the youngest and first openly gay American president. Amid the start of Buttigieg's presidential effort, on February 12, 2019, he published his debut book, autobiography Shortest Way Home. Two months later, Buttigieg officially launched his campaign on April 14, 2019, in South Bend.Buttigieg described himself as a progressive and a supporter of democratic capitalism.

Buttigieg identifies regulatory capture as a significant problem in American society.Initially regarded as a long-shot candidate, Buttigieg rose into the top-tier of candidates in the primary by December 2019. In early February 2020, Buttigieg led the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses results with 26.2 percent to Bernie Sanders' 26.1 percent, winning 14 delegates to Sanders's 12. The LGBTQ Victory Fund, Buttigieg's first national endorsement, noted the historical first of an openly gay candidate winning a state presidential primary. Buttigieg finished second behind Sanders in the New Hampshire primary. After placing a fourth in the South Carolina primary with 8.2 percent of the vote, behind Joe Biden (48.7 percent), Bernie Sanders (19.8 percent), and Tom Steyer (11.3 percent), Buttigieg dropped out of the race on March 1, 2020, and endorsed Biden.",
        "Post-presidential campaign": "In April 2020, Buttigieg launched Win The Era PAC, a new super PAC to raise money and distribute it to down-ballot Democrats. The PAC focused on local elected positions, and its list of endorsements included candidates such as Jaime Harrison, Cal Cunningham, Gina Ortiz Jones, Christine Hunschofsky, and Levar Stoney.

        "Secretary of Transportation": "Following the end of his presidential campaign, Buttigieg was considered a possible Cabinet appointee in Joe Biden's administration. After Biden was declared the winner of the election on November 7, 2020, Buttigieg was again mentioned as a possible nominee for Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador to China or Secretary of Transportation. On December 15, 2020, Biden announced that he would nominate Buttigieg as his Secretary of Transportation. The Senate Commerce Committee advanced Buttigieg's nomination to the full Senate with a vote of 21\u20133. Buttigieg was confirmed on February 2, 2021, with a vote of 86\u201313; and was sworn in the next morning.\n\nAs Secretary of Transportation, Buttigieg has worked on re-organizing the department's internal policy structure, including carrying out a thorough review process of rules enacted under the Trump administration. For example, Buttigieg reinstated an Obama-era pilot program which ensures local hiring for public works projects on May 19, 2021, with the goal of helping minorities and disadvantaged individuals. This program had been revoked in 2017 during the Trump administration, when the Department of Transportation returned to rules established during the Reagan administration, which banned geographic-based hiring preferences.Buttigieg addressed the African American Mayors Association in late February 2021 to discuss systemic racism. He argued that misguided investments in the federal transport and infrastructure policy had contributed to racial inequity. In early March 2021, Politico noted that Buttigieg had mentioned racial equity in almost every interview he gave to the press as it related to his work at the department. In late June 2022, Buttigieg launched a $1 billion Reconnecting Communities pilot program to establish racial equity in roads. Using money from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the program aims to reconnect cities and neighborhoods divided by roads through projects such as rapid bus lines, pedestrian walkways, and planning studies.Early into his tenure, Buttigieg noted that the United States's actions surrounding road traffic safety is lacking and suggested improving the design of roads. Also, while acknowledging how the United States fell behind other developed countries with respect to bicycle and pedestrian safety, Buttigieg encouraged greater focus on human behavior in infrastructure policy. Likewise, in March 2021, Buttigieg indicated he was open to tolls on Interstate 80, but not the tollage of bridges, suggesting \"big picture solutions\" instead, like a mileage tax. However, the Biden administration did not include a gas tax or mileage tax in the infrastructure plan it released that month.Buttigieg informed Congress in late March 2021 that the Biden administration was planning to prioritize the construction of the Gateway Rail Tunnel Project due to its economic significance. The progress of the project, which was stalled by President Trump, was said to be moving faster, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Buttigieg announced the environmental impact assessment of the project\u2014which was largely seen as a sign of major progress on the project. Also, Buttigieg has served as a promoter of the American Jobs Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\nIn June 2021, the White House created a task force to address supply chain disruptions, with Buttigieg as one of its leaders. By October 2021, global supply bottlenecks had resulted in record shortages of household goods for American consumers. Buttigieg cited high demand and the pandemic as some of the causes for the disruptions, while predicting that the disruptions would \"continue into next year\".After conservatives criticized Buttigieg for taking paternity leave, Buttigieg declared that he would not apologize for \"taking care of my premature newborn infant twins. The work that we are doing is joyful, fulfilling, wonderful work.\" According to his department, Buttigieg had been on paid leave since mid-August 2021, where for a month he was \"mostly offline except for major agency decisions and matters that could not be delegated\", and he \"has been ramping up activities since then\", making many media appearances in early October 2021.

Emergency crews conducted a controlled burn of the spill at the request of state officials, which released hydrogen chloride and phosgene into the air. As a result, residents within a 1 mi (1.6 km) radius were evacuated. Buttigieg tweeted on February 13 the Department would \"use all relevant authorities to ensure accountability and continue to support safety.\"In the weeks following the derailment, Buttigieg\u2019s Transportation Department did not move to reinstate the 2015 rail safety rule aimed at expanding the use of better braking technology. Buttigieg\u2019s Transportation Department was contemplating stripping down brake safety rules even further.Buttigieg has faced criticism across the political spectrum for his response to the derailment, from Democrats Nina Turner and Ilhan Omar and Republicans JD Vance and Anna Paulina Luna.On February 23, 2023, NTSB released a preliminary report stating that the wheel bearings overheated, with temperatures as high as 253 degrees Fahrenheit above the ambient temperature.",

        "Military service": "As highlighted in Fred Kaplan\u2019s book, The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War, Chewning left a career as a Wall Street investment banker to join in the U.S. Army in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.  Upon completing Officer Candidate School and training as a military intelligence officer, he was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment in the 2nd Brigade of the U.S. Army\u2019s First Cavalry Division.  He deployed to Iraq in 2004 serving as the unit\u2019s tactical intelligence officer.  During this deployment, Chewning helped to pioneer counterinsurgency tactics for conventional U.S. Army units.\nUpon returning to the U.S., Chewning and Douglas Ollivant co-authored an influential article in Military Review, entitled \"Producing Victory: Rethinking Conventional Forces in Counterinsurgency Operations\",  and a 2007 follow-on article, entitled \"Producing Victory: a 2007 postscript for implementation.\" The articles argued that U.S. forces needed to abandon sprawling forward operating bases and move into Iraqi communities.  The premise of their argument was that counterinsurgency requires military units to simultaneous execute security operations, train local security forces, promote economic development, and foster political institutions.  Ollivant and Chewning reasoned that conventional military units best operate in such an environment when partnered with indigenous security forces co-located among the target population.\nThe essays, which were based on Ollivant and Chewning\u2019s experience during combat operations in Iraq in 2004 and 2005, significantly influenced the tactical deployment of US and Iraqi ground forces during the \u201cSurge\u201d.  A 2006 New York Times op-ed called it \u201ca good blueprint\u201d for turning around the military situation in Iraq.

In this role, Chewning focused on issues at the intersection of technology, industrial enterprises, and national security.  He supported a more geoeconomic approach to DoD industrial policy, specifically in countering the macro forces working against the health of the U.S. defense industrial base. \nChewning was the architect of the U.S. government-wide assessment of the manufacturing and defense industrial base called for in President Trump's Executive Order 13806.  The report identified five macro forces that needed to be addressed:\nSequestration and DoD budget uncertainty\nDecline of U.S. manufacturing capability and capacity\nHarmful U.S. government business practices\nIndustrial policies of competitor nations \u2013 specifically China\nDiminishing U.S. stem and trade skills.The unclassified version of the report identified over 300 specific industrial base risks ranging from access to rare earth magnets to single, sole source suppliers for key military equipment like cannon gun tubes.\nHe also testified before the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to advocate to modernize the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and address the transfer of militarily relevant technologies to China. This culminated in the passage of the Foreign Investment Risk Modernization Act as part of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act.\nIn a November 2018 speech at the Atlantic Council on implementing defense industrial policy, Eric outlined five levers by which the Department of Defense implements its industrial policy.

        "Introduction": "Chelsea Victoria Clinton (born February 27, 1980) is an American writer and global health advocate. She is the only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

        "Early years": "Clinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 27, 1980, the only child of Hillary and Bill Clinton. Her name was inspired by a visit to the Chelsea neighborhood of London during a Christmas 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 Judy Collins recording of the Joni Mitchell song \"Chelsea Morning\", Bill remarked, \"If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea.\"When Clinton was two years old, she accompanied her parents as they campaigned throughout Arkansas for her father's gubernatorial race. She learned to read and write at a very young age. Clinton claims that she started reading the newspaper by the age of three and also wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan when she was only five. In the letter, which was photocopied and preserved by her father, she asked President Reagan not to visit a military cemetery in West Germany, which includes graves of Nazi soldiers. Clinton attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School, both Little Rock public schools. She skipped the third grade.As a young child, Clinton was raised in her father's Southern Baptist faith, and later attended her mother's United Methodist church.",
        "White House years": "On January 20, 1993, the day of her father's first inauguration, Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the Secret Service codename \"Energy\". The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.Hillary Clinton followed the advice of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits. Margaret Truman, daughter of former president Harry S. Truman, supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.\nFollowing her attendance at Horace Mann Junior High, the Clintons decided to remove Chelsea from public school and send her to Sidwell Friends School, a private school in Washington, D.C. While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, Amy Carter, had gone to D.C. public schools. Although their decision drew some criticism as a perceived rejection of the public school system, Bill defended the decision as an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy and allow her to determine her own future. During her time at the school, Sidwell's students and staff generally declined to discuss Chelsea with the press. A veteran of Model United Nations, Clinton was a 1997 National Merit Scholarship semifinalist. She graduated from Sidwell in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony. Media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend Stanford University. \nThroughout her father's time in the White House, journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although Rush Limbaugh and Saturday Night Live both broadcast material mocking her appearance. During this phase of her life, her father said, \"We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth ... It's tough when you are an adolescent ... but I think she'll be ok.\"In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by People that examined Chelsea's relationship with her parents in the wake of the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The Secret Service told the magazine they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. People ran the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their disappointment. Carol Wallace, People's managing editor, felt that Chelsea, then 19, was \"an eyewitness to family drama and historical events\" and thus \"a valid journalistic subject\". The article, entitled \"Grace Under Fire\", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in The New York Times and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. One author determined that she had received the most television coverage of all presidential children preceding her, although they noted that only she and Maureen Reagan had a full eight years as presidential children. During the last year of her father's presidency, Chelsea assumed some White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate, traveling with her father on several overseas trips and attending state dinners with him.",
        "Activities": "Although her father was a Southern Baptist, Clinton was raised in and adheres to her mother's Methodist faith. As a teenager, she attended the youth ministry group at Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, where her parents sometimes joined her. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be \"a terrific kid\" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group.At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas, and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years. In her book, It Takes a Village, Hillary wrote that Bill was disappointed when Chelsea quit softball and soccer to concentrate on ballet, but he was nonetheless supportive, regularly attending her performances. She was cast in the role of the Favorite Aunt in the 1993 Washington Ballet production of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker.",
        "Education and academic life": "No information",
        "Stanford University": "Clinton entered Stanford University in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm. With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.Clinton obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, with highest honors, at Stanford in 2001. The topic of her 167-page senior thesis was the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, advised by Jack Rakove. At the time of Chelsea's graduation, her father issued a statement: \"Hillary and I are grateful for the friendships and great learning experiences Chelsea had at Stanford, and we are very proud of her on this special day.\"",
        "University of Oxford": "Starting in 2001, Chelsea pursued a master's degree at University College of the University of Oxford where her father had studied politics as a Rhodes Scholar. Lord Butler of Brockwell, the Master of University College, said: \"Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student. The college is also pleased to extend its link with the Clinton family.\" Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures, and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.\nArriving at Oxford just after the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans\u2014people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.\nClinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper Oxford Student, whose editorial attacking her angered the university. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, as she adjusted successfully to life abroad.At Oxford University in 2003, Clinton completed a Master of Philosophy degree in international relations. Her 132-page thesis was titled The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future, supervised by Jennifer Welsh and Ngaire Woods. Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.",

She stated this was to be under her preferred doctoral advisor, Ngaire Woods. She finished her dissertation in New York City and was awarded the degree in May 2014. Her dissertation was titled The Global Fund: An Experiment in Global Governance.In 2012, Clinton received an award from interfaith organization Temple of Understanding for her \"work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life\", together with Imam Khalid Latif and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.",
        "Professional life": "In 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City, and she went to work for Avenue Capital Group in late 2006.

        "Political activities": "No information",
        "Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign": "In December 2007, Clinton began campaigning in Iowa in support of her mother's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. She appeared across the country, largely on college campuses. By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 colleges on behalf of her mother's candidacy.While campaigning, Clinton answered audience questions but did not give interviews or respond to press questions, including one from a nine-year-old Scholastic News reporter asking whether her father would be a good \"first man\". She replied, \"I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately. Even though I think you're cute.\" Philippe Reines, her mother's press secretary, intervened when the press attempted to approach Chelsea directly.When MSNBC reporter David Shuster characterized Clinton's participation in her mother's campaign as \"sort of being pimped out\", the Clinton campaign objected. Shuster subsequently apologized on-air and was suspended for two weeks.The first time she was asked about her mother's handling of the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal at a campaign stop Clinton responded, \"I do not think that is any of your business.\" As she became a more experienced campaigner, she refined her responses and deflected questions on the issue with comments such as, \"If that's what you want to vote on, that's what you should vote on. But I think there are other people [who are] going to vote on things like healthcare and economics.\"At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary \"my hero and my mother\" and introduced her with a long video tribute.",
        "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign": "As she did in 2008, Clinton again took an active part in her mother's presidential campaign in 2016, expanding her role as surrogate at more than 200 public events across the country, including and beyond college campuses. In July 2016, she introduced her mother at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, in a personal, emotional tribute recalling her own upbringing and describing her mother's commitment to issues and to public service.Throughout the primary and general election campaigns, Clinton spoke about her mother's lifelong work on behalf of women, families, and children, highlighting her positions on healthcare, affordable college tuition and reduction of student debt, climate change, women's reproductive rights, immigration reform, gun violence, and the importance of voter turnout. Clinton gave birth to her second child during the campaign, five weeks before the convention, and she frequently spoke about motherhood and the issues women face in balancing work and home, including the challenges of breastfeeding.Even prior to her mother's receiving the nomination, Clinton frequently spoke out against candidate Donald Trump's positions and rhetoric, explaining to reporters in Indianapolis in April that she does so because \"I think it's important [for] all of us who feel like Mr. Trump's rhetoric of sexism and racism and Islamophobia and anti-immigrant hatred and stance has no place in our country.\" Later, at a September general election campaign stop in Arizona, she further said, \"I never thought I would see in my lifetime the almost daily diet of hate speech coming out of Donald Trump ... that too often goes unanswered and unrepudiated by the Republicans. The racism, the sexism, the Islamophobia, the homophobia, the jingoism, the demeaning rhetoric against Americans with disabilities, the disrespect for our veterans, the disrespect for a Gold Star family\"; additionally, she also called his stand against Constitutionally guaranteed birthright citizenship \"un-American\". At one appearance in September 2016, while answering a question about her mother's position supporting medical marijuana research, Clinton got some attention for an inaccurate comment she made regarding drug interactions with marijuana; she walked back the comment a few days later, acknowledging that she misspoke.",

        "Social investment": "In 2000, at the invitation of the Treasury he became Chairman of the Social Investment Task Force (SITF). The remit of the SITF was \"to set out how entrepreneurial practices could be applied to obtain higher social and financial returns from social investment, to harness new talents and skills, to address economic regeneration and to unleash new sources of private and institutional investment\". The SITF made several recommendations to Government, including that it: (1) introduce Community Investment Tax Relief (CITR); (2) match finance to help set up the first community development venture capital fund; (3) encourage banks to disclose more of their lending activities; (4) to support legislative and regulatory changes to provide greater latitude and encouragement for charitable trusts and foundations to invest in community development finance; and (5) to create the Community Development Finance Association (cdfa) to provide support for community development finance institutions (CDFIs).In 2002, he co-founded and became chairman of Bridges Ventures, an innovative sustainable growth investor that delivers both financial returns and social and environmental benefits. Bridges Ventures has raised eight successful funds to date: Bridges Sustainable Growth Funds I, II and III, the Bridges Sustainable Property Fund, the CarePlaces Fund, Bridges Property Alternatives III, the Bridges Social Entrepreneurs Fund, and the Bridges Social Impact Bond Fund.

Portland Trust is involved in a number of important initiatives, including the development of financial and economic infrastructure, housing, trade, investment, and entrepreneurship. The Portland Trust has offices in London, Tel Aviv and Ramallah.\nIn 2005, Cohen chaired the Commission on Unclaimed Assets. which looked into how unclaimed funds from dormant bank accounts could be used to benefit the public. The final recommendation of the Commission was that a Social Investment Wholesale Bank be created to help finance charitable and voluntary projects by providing seed capital and loan guarantees.In 2007 he co-founded and became a non-executive director of Social Finance UK, a London-based advisory organisation that has worked to create a social investment market in the UK. The organisation provides access to capital, designs social finance interventions and offers advice to investors and social sector entities interested in delivering significant social impact. It has developed the social impact bond which is a financial instrument that is an outcomes-based contract in which public sector commissioners commit to pay for significant improvement in social outcomes for a defined population. Social Finance set up a pilot social impact bond with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in September 2010 to reduce re-offending amongst male prisoners leaving HMP Peterborough who have served a sentence of less than 12 months. During the Peterborough Prison pilot, experienced social sector organisations, such as St. Giles Trust and the Ormiston Children and Families Trust, provided intensive support to 3,000 short-term prisoners over a six-year period, both inside prison and after release, to help them resettle into the community. In July 2017, the success of the Peterborough Social Impact Bond was announced. The results showed reoffending of short-sentenced offenders reduced by 9% overall compared to a national control group. This exceeded the target of 7.5% set by the Ministry of Justice. As a result, the 17 investors in the Peterborough Social Impact Bond receive a single payment representing their initial capital plus an amount that will represent a return of just over 3% per annum for the period of investment. Cohen is also a member of the board of directors for Social Finance UK's sister organisation in the United States, Social Finance US.\nIn 2010, Cohen chaired a review of the work of the SITF in 2010 and published a report titled Social Investment: Ten Years On which assess the changes that had happened over the last decade in the area of social investment. The report found that there are three specific initiatives that will help define the future of the social investment market in the UK: (1) establishing the infrastructure necessary to create a dynamic market in social investment through initiatives such as the Social Investment Bank; (2) creating new tools to deliver social change through financial instruments such as the social impact bond; (3) engaging the financial sector to invest in disadvantaged areas through the Community Reinvestment Act.",

Pension funds were transferred to the new BUSM scheme two weeks before receivership, and 4 days before a new revaluation was due.\nMPs Edward Garnier, Patricia Hewitt and Ashok Kumar all called for a proper enquiry, Garnier citing the \"mysterious circumstances\" under which the pensions \"disappeared\", whilst Hewitt said \"it is clearly important that such serious allegations are properly investigated.\" No new investigation took place, leading Kumar to say \"I think these people need flogging. I feel so angry on behalf of decent upright citizens robbed of their basic human rights. ... These are greedy, selfish capitalists who live on the backs of others.\"In 2007, the GMB (trade union) blamed private equity firms for the collapse of 96 pension funds and linked Cohen with losses totalling \u00a381m at Dexion, British United Shoe Machinery and USM Texon.",

A member of the Republican Party, he served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2013 to 2015.\nCotton was elected as the U.S. representative for Arkansas's 4th congressional district in 2012 and to the Senate at age 37 in 2014, defeating two-term Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor.",
        "Early life and education": "Thomas Bryant Cotton was born on May 13, 1977, in Dardanelle, Arkansas. His father, Thomas Leonard \"Len\" Cotton, was a district supervisor in the Arkansas Department of Health, and his mother, Avis (n\u00e9e  Bryant) Cotton, was a schoolteacher who later became principal of their district's middle school. Cotton's family had lived in rural Arkansas for seven generations, and he grew up on his family's cattle farm. He attended Dardanelle High School, where he played on the local and regional basketball teams; standing 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall, he was usually required to play center.Cotton was accepted to Harvard College after graduating from high school in 1995. At Harvard, he majored in government and was a member of the editorial board of The Harvard Crimson, often dissenting from the liberal majority. In articles, Cotton addressed what he saw as \"sacred cows\" such as affirmative action. He graduated with an A.B. magna cum laude in 1998 after only three years of study. Cotton's senior thesis focused on The Federalist Papers.After graduating from Harvard College in 1998, Cotton was accepted into a master's program at Claremont Graduate University. He left in 1999, saying that he found academic life \"too sedentary\", and instead enrolled at Harvard Law School. He graduated with a J.D. degree in 2002.",
        "Career": "After graduating from Harvard Law School, Cotton spent one year as a law clerk for Judge Jerry Edwin Smith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. He then went into private practice as an associate at law firms Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and Cooper & Kirk in Washington, D.C., until he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2005.",
        "Military service": "On January 11, 2005, Cotton enlisted in the United States Army. He entered Officer Candidate School (OCS) in March 2005 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in June. He completed the U.S. Army Ranger Course, a 62-day small unit tactics and leadership program that earned him the Ranger tab, and Airborne School to earn the Parachutist Badge.In May 2006, Cotton was deployed to Baghdad as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) as a platoon leader with the 101st Airborne Division. In Iraq, he led a 41-man air assault infantry platoon in the 506th Infantry Regiment, and planned and performed daily combat patrols.In December 2006 Cotton was promoted to first lieutenant and reassigned to the 3d Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) at Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia, as a platoon leader.From October 2008 to July 2009, Cotton was deployed to eastern Afghanistan. He was assigned within the Train Advise Assist Command \u2013 East at its Gamberi forward operating base (FOB) in Laghman Province as the operations officer of a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), where he planned daily counter-insurgency and reconstruction operations.Cotton was honorably discharged in September 2009. During his time in the service, he completed two combat deployments overseas, was awarded a Bronze Star, two Army Commendation Medals, a Combat Infantryman Badge, a Ranger tab, an Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and an Iraq Campaign Medal. In July 2010, Cotton entered the Army Reserve (USAR). He was discharged in May 2013.",
        "2006 letter to The New York Times": "In June 2006, while stationed in Iraq, Cotton gained public attention after writing an open letter to the editor of The New York Times, asserting three journalists had violated \"espionage laws\" by publishing an article detailing a classified government program monitoring terrorists' finances. The Times did not publish Cotton's letter, but it was published on Power Line, a conservative blog that had been copied on the email. In the letter, Cotton called for the journalists to be prosecuted for espionage \"to the fullest extent of the law\" and incarcerated. He accused the newspaper of having \"gravely endangered the lives of my soldiers and all other soldiers and innocent Iraqis\". Cotton's claims circulated online and were reprinted in full elsewhere. According to Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at New York University in 2011, the Espionage Act has never been used against journalists. Rosen argued accusing investigative journalists of engaging in espionage is \"essentially saying that they\u2019re working for another power, or aiding the enemy. That is culture war tactics taken to an extreme.\"",
        "Army Ranger controversy": "In 2021, Salon reported that Cotton falsely claimed in campaign ads and videos from 2011 to 2014 that he had served in Iraq and Afghanistan and earned a Bronze Star as a U.S. Army Ranger even though he did not serve in the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment. Fact-checking site Snopes rated Salon's reporting as true. In response to the article, Democratic congressman Jason Crow, who served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, criticized Cotton for calling himself a Ranger. A spokesperson for Cotton said, \"To be clear, as he's stated many times, Senator Cotton graduated from Ranger School, earned the Ranger Tab, and served a combat tour with the 101st Airborne, not the 75th Ranger Regiment.\" As the Salon story garnered widespread attention, Cotton's spokeswoman recommended that the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette talk to retired Command Sergeant Major Rick Merritt, a former regimental sergeant major of the 75th Ranger Regiment, who said that Cotton is \"100% a Ranger. He will always be a Ranger. It\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s almost slanderous.\"In an article on the controversy, Business Insider wrote, \"[w]hile the distinction [between being a \"Ranger\" and attending Ranger School] is rarely brought up outside of military circles, it has been fiercely debated among veterans and encapsulates the nuances of military titles.\"Cotton dismissed allegations of falsifying his military record as politically driven. \"I graduated from the Ranger School, I wore the Ranger tab in combat with the 101st Airborne in Iraq. This is not about my military record. This is about my politics.\"",
        "Political career": "Shortly after Cotton's Afghanistan deployment ended, he was introduced to Chris Chocola, a former congressman and the president of Club for Growth, a Republican political action committee that became one of Cotton's top contributors. Cotton considered a run against incumbent Democratic U.S. senator Blanche Lincoln in 2010 but declined due to lack of donors and believing it was premature. After the retirement announcement of Democratic incumbent Mike Ross in 2011, Cotton ran for Congress in Arkansas's 4th congressional district.Following his active duty service, Cotton went to work for management consulting firm McKinsey & Company before running for Congress in Arkansas's 4th congressional district when Democratic incumbent Mike Ross announced in 2011 that he would not seek reelection.",

Cotton later said the internet had matured since he wrote the article.Beth Anne Rankin, the 2010 Republican nominee, and John David Cowart, who was backed by Louisiana businessman and philanthropist Edgar Cason, were the only other Republican candidates in the race after Marcus Richmond dropped out in February 2012. In the May 22 primary, Cotton won the Republican nomination with 57.6% of the vote; Rankin finished second with 37.1%.The Club for Growth endorsed Cotton. Of the $2.2 million Cotton raised for his campaign, Club for Growth donors accounted for $315,000 and were his largest supporters. Senator John McCain also endorsed him. Cotton was supported by both the Tea Party movement and the Republican establishment.In the November 6 general election, Cotton defeated state senator Gene Jeffress, 59.5% to 36.7%.

Stuart Rothenberg of Roll Call called Pryor the most vulnerable senator seeking reelection that year. Cotton was endorsed by the conservative Club for Growth PAC, Senator Marco Rubio, the National Federation of Independent Business, and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who campaigned for Cotton. The Associated Press called the race for Cotton immediately after the polls closed; he received 56.5% of the vote to Pryor's 39.4%. Cotton was sworn into office on January 6, 2015.As a U.S. senator, Cotton has received multiple death threats. In 2018, Adam Albrett of Fairfax County, Virginia, was arrested for \"faxing death threats\" against President Donald Trump and members of Congress, including Cotton. Police traced the fax to Albrett using the phone number in the fax header.In October 2019, local authorities charged James Powell, a 43-year-old Arkansas resident, with \"first-degree terroristic threatening\" after an investigation by U.S. Capitol Police and the FBI. The felony charge carries a maximum six-year prison sentence and $10,000 fine. Powell also threatened Arkansas Representative Rick Crawford with death. In January 2020, 78-year-old Henry Edward Goodloe was sentenced to two years' probation for sending Cotton a threatening letter and a package containing white powder. Goodloe admitted to mailing an envelope containing white powder to Cotton's office, with a note stating, \"You ignored me. Maybe this will get your attention.\" The Senate mail facility intercepted the letter, which included Goodloe's home address, and alerted a hazardous response team which determined the powder was unbleached flour and starch.",
        "2020": "Cotton was reelected, defeating Libertarian challenger Ricky Dale Harrington Jr. Though Cotton outperformed President Donald Trump in the concurrent presidential election by 4.1%, the election saw an undervote of 26,000 compared to the presidential election. Harrington's 33.5% finish is the best ever for a Libertarian candidate in a U.S. Senate election by vote percentage, surpassing the previous record set in 2016 in Alaska, and also by total number of votes (399,390, surpassing the previous record of 369,807 set by Michael Cloud in Massachusetts in 2002). Per exit polls, this largely appears to be due to many Democrats voting for Harrington as there was no Democratic candidate on the ballot (82% of Democratic voters backed Harrington).",
        "Cassandra Butts nomination": "In February 2015, Obama renominated Cassandra Butts, a former White House lawyer, to be the United States ambassador to the Bahamas. Her nomination was blocked by several senators. First, Ted Cruz placed a blanket hold on all U.S. State Department nominees. Cotton specifically blocked the nominations of Butts and ambassador nominees to Sweden and Norway after the Secret Service leaked private information about a fellow member of Congress, although that issue was unrelated to those nominees. Cotton eventually released his holds on the nominees to Sweden and Norway, but kept his hold on Butts's nomination.Butts told New York Times columnist Frank Bruni that she had gone to see Cotton about his objections to her nomination and said he had told her that because he knew that Obama and Butts were friends, it was a way to \"inflict special pain on the president\", Bruni said. Cotton's spokeswoman did not dispute Butts's characterization. Butts died on May 26, 2016, still awaiting a Senate vote.",
        "Trump administration": "During Trump's presidency, Cotton was characterized as a Trump loyalist. He frequently met with Trump's staff during the transition period, and according to Steve Bannon, suggested John F. Kelly as U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security. Bannon told The New Yorker in November 2017, \"Next to Trump, he's the elected official who gets it the most\u2014the economic nationalism. Cotton was the one most supportive of us, up front and behind the scenes, from the beginning. He understands that the Washington \u00e9lite\u2014this permanent political class of both parties ... needs to be shattered.\" In the same article, Karl Rove, a senior figure in the George W. Bush administration, said Cotton was a more consensual figure than someone like Bannon.In a CNN interview shortly after the 2016 presidential election, Cotton denied that waterboarding is a form of torture. He said \"tough calls\" such as allowing it were an option Trump was ready to take: \"If experienced intelligence officials come to the President of the United States and say we think this terrorist has critical information and we need to obtain it and this is the only way we can obtain it\u2014it's a tough call. But the presidency is a tough job. And if you're not ready to make those tough calls, you shouldn't seek the office. Donald Trump's a pretty tough guy, and he's ready to make those tough calls\". During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said the United States should resume the use of waterboarding.In September 2020, Trump shortlisted Cotton as a potential Supreme Court nominee, but ultimately chose Amy Coney Barrett instead. With less than two months to the next presidential election, Cotton supported an immediate Senate vote on Trump's nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. In March 2016, Cotton refused to consider Obama's Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year, providing his rationale with these questions: \"Why would we cut off the national debate on the next justice? Why would we squelch the voice of the populace? Why would we deny the voters a chance to weigh in on the makeup of the Supreme Court?\"In early January 2021, Cotton announced he would not support any attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election during the joint congressional certification of Electoral College results on January 6, 2021.",

        "2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill": "Cotton was one of 18 Republican senators to vote for the $1.7 trillion omnibus bill that former President Donald Trump criticized. The bill earmarked $45 billion more for Ukraine to defend itself against Russia, but prohibited funding for more immigration barriers in the U.S. and did not raise border enforcement spending past current inflation levels.",
        "Race relations": "Cotton drew scrutiny for columns he wrote for The Harvard Crimson about race relations in America, calling Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton \"race-hustling charlatans\" and saying race relations \"would almost certainly improve if we stopped emphasizing race in our public life.\"In 2016, Cotton rejected the claim that too many criminals are being jailed, that there is over-incarceration in the United States, as \"Law enforcement is able to arrest or identify a likely perpetrator for only 19 percent of property crimes and 47 percent of violent crimes. If anything, we have an under-incarceration problem\". Cotton said that reduced sentencing for felons would destabilize the United States, arguing that \"I saw this in Baghdad. We\u2019ve seen it again in Afghanistan.\"In November 2018, while arguing against a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, Cotton incorrectly said that there had been no hearings on the bill. PolitiFact stated Cotton had \"ignored years of congressional debate and hearings on the general topics of the bill, as well as the consideration and bipartisan passage of largely similar bills at the House committee level, by the full House, and by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\" Arguing against the bill in question, the FIRST STEP Act, Cotton asserted that \"convicts of certain sex-related crimes could accrue credits making them eligible for supervised release or 'pre-release' to a halfway house\". A spokesperson for Mike Lee responded that \"just because a federal offense is not on the specific list of ineligible offenses doesn't mean inmates who committed [a] non-specified offense will earn early release\". The bill passed 87\u201312 on December 18, 2018. Cotton voted against it.",
        "Black Lives Matter": "Following the murder of George Floyd, Cotton rejected the view that there is \"systemic racism in the criminal justice system in America\". Amid the ensuing protests, Cotton advocated on Twitter that the military be used to support police, and to give \"no quarter for insurrectionists, anarchists, rioters, and looters.\" In the military, the term no quarter refers to the killing of lawfully surrendering combatants, which is a war crime under the Geneva Convention. Cotton subsequently said that he was using the \"colloquial\" version of the phrase and cited examples of Democrats and the mainstream media using the phrase.A few days later, The New York Times published an opinion piece by Cotton titled \"Send in the Troops\", arguing for the deployment of federal troops to counter looting and rioting in major American cities. Dozens of Times staff members sharply criticized the decision to publish Cotton's article, calling its rhetoric dangerous. Following the negative response from staffers, the Times responded by saying the piece went through a \"rushed editorial process\" that would be reexamined. Editorial page editor James Bennet resigned days later. Cotton criticized the Times for retracting his piece, saying, \"The New York Times editorial page editor and owner defended it in public statements but then they totally surrendered to a woke child mob from their own newsroom that apparently gets triggered if they're presented with any opinion contrary to their own, as opposed to telling the woke children in their newsroom this is the workplace, not a social justice seminar on campus\".",
        "Statements about slavery": "In July 2020, Cotton introduced the Saving American History Act of 2020, proposed legislation preventing the use of federal tax dollars for the teaching of The 1619 Project, an initiative of The New York Times. In an interview with the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Cotton said of slavery, \"As the Founding Fathers said, it was the necessary evil upon which the union was built, but the union was built in a way, as Lincoln said, to put slavery on the course to its ultimate extinction.\" Joshua D. Rothman, a history professor at the University of Alabama, responded that slavery was neither \"necessary\" nor on the way to \"extinction\" when America was founded, because it \"was a choice defended or accepted by most white Americans for generations, and it expanded dramatically between the Revolution and the Civil War\".1619 Project director Nikole Hannah-Jones tweeted: \"If chattel slavery\u2014heritable, generational, permanent, race-based slavery where it was legal to rape, torture, and sell human beings for profit\u2014were a 'necessary evil' as @TomCottonAR says, it\u2019s hard to imagine what cannot be justified if it is a means to an end.\" Cotton responded, \"more lies from the debunked 1619 Project\" and said he was \"not endorsing or justifying slavery\" because he was relaying what he believed were the \"views of the Founders\". Georgetown University historian Adam Rothman said Cotton's phrase is \"really a kind of shorthand way of describing the complex set of attitudes of the founding generation and it's not really accurate.\" \"Of course slavery is an evil institution in all its forms, at all times in America's past, or around the world today,\" Cotton said on Fox News on July 27.",
        "COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act": "Cotton was one of six Republican senators to vote against advancing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would allow the U.S. Justice Department to review hate crimes related to COVID-19 and establish an online database.",
        "Gun laws": "In January 2019, Cotton was one of 31 Republican senators to cosponsor the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill introduced by John Cornyn and Ted Cruz that would grant individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state the right to exercise this right in any other state with concealed carry laws while concurrently abiding by that state's laws.Cotton has an A rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA), which endorsed him in the 2014 election. The NRA's Chris W. Cox said, \"Tom Cotton will always stand up for the values and freedoms of Arkansas gun owners and sportsmen.\" In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Cotton said that he did not believe any new gun control legislation would have prevented the shooting.",
        "Immigration": "Cotton's 2012 campaign website stated, \"We cannot afford to grant illegal aliens amnesty or a so-called 'earned path to citizenship.'\"In July 2013, after the Senate's bipartisan Gang of Eight passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013, an immigration reform proposal, House Republicans held a closed-door meeting to decide whether to bring the bill to a vote. Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan spoke at one podium arguing for its passage; Cotton spoke at another arguing against it, even exchanging terse comments with Speaker Boehner. The House decided to not consider the bill. Cotton supported Trump's 2017 Executive Order 13769 prohibiting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.On February 7, 2017, in the presence of President Trump, Cotton and Senator David Perdue proposed a new immigration bill, the RAISE Act, which would limit the family route or chain migration. The bill would set a limit on the number of refugees offered residency at 50,000 a year and would remove the Diversity Immigrant Visa. Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain expressed opposition to the bill.Cotton, a supporter of Trump on immigration, was present at a January 11, 2018, meeting at which Trump is alleged to have called Haiti and African nations \"shithole countries.\" Cotton and Senator David Perdue said in a joint statement that \"we do not recall the President saying these comments specifically\". In a statement, the White House did not deny that Trump had made the comment, although Trump did in a tweet the following day. The Washington Post reported that Cotton and Perdue told the White House they heard \"shithouse\" rather than \"shithole\". Cotton reiterated on CBS's Face The Nation, \"I certainly didn't hear what Senator Durbin has said repeatedly\". \"Senator Durbin has a history of misrepresenting what happens in White House meetings, though, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by that\", Cotton added. Slate magazine asserted that Cotton was referring to a misquotation Dick Durbin made of a 2013 gathering at the Obama White House at which Durbin was not present, nor had he claimed to be present. Durbin was not the only person at the meeting to confirm Trump's words; another was Lindsey Graham.In December 2018, Cotton placed a senatorial hold on H.R.7164 - A Bill to add Ireland to the E-3 Non-immigrant Visa Program. The bill did not create new non-immigrant visas, but rather allowed Irish college graduates to apply for any surplus E-3 visas in Specialty Occupations that had gone unused by Australians within their annual cap of 10,500. The bipartisan bill had passed the House of Representatives on November 28, 2018, and had also received the backing of the Trump administration. Because of Cotton's hold, it did not reach the Senate floor for consideration.Cotton's immigration positions have led to protests at his Washington office. In January 2018, five demonstrators were arrested for obstructing his office while they were protesting his position on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. They were released after paying a $50 fine.In February 2021, in a speech at CPAC, Cotton criticized the Democrats' and Joe Biden's immigration policies. Cotton claimed, \"They have halted deportations for all illegal aliens. Murderers, rapists, terrorists, MS-13 gang members are not being deported.\" PolitiFact rated Cotton's claim as \"False\" and elaborated that the \"Biden\u2019s administration ordered a 100-day deportation pause, but it did not apply to criminals such as murderers, rapists, terrorists or gang members.\"In September 2021, the Senate voted along partisan lines to reject Cotton's amendment that sought to curtail assistance to Afghan refugees after the Taliban took over Afghanistan, and hinder the refugees' ability to obtain federally recognized identification cards without proving their identity.",
        "Health and social issues": "Cotton opposed the Affordable Care Act, saying in 2012 that \"the first step is to repeal that law, which is offensive to a free society and a free people\".In April 2019, Cotton called the Southern Poverty Law Center a \"political hate group\" and asked the IRS to check whether it should retain its tax-exempt status.In 2012, Cotton said, \"Strong families also depend on strong marriages, and I support the traditional understanding of marriage as the union of one man and one woman. I also support the Defense of Marriage Act.\" In 2013, Cotton voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, saying that the federal powers in the act were too broad.",
        "Abortion and related issues": "In June 2013, Cotton voted in favor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill to ban abortion after 20 or more weeks following fertilization. He has said that Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey were \"wrongly decided as a constitutional matter\" and that the legality of abortion should be up to politicians in the individual states. He was one of 183 co-sponsors of the version of the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act introduced in 2013. After Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, Cotton called Roe a \"tragic mistake\" that had been \"corrected\" and said he \"highly commends the millions of Americans who toiled for years to achieve this great victory for unborn life and self-government.\u201dCotton has said, \"I oppose the destruction of human embryos to conduct stem-cell research and all forms of human cloning.\"",
        "Student loans": "In August 2013, Cotton voted against the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, which sets interest rates on student loans to the 10-year Treasury note plus a varying markup for undergraduate and graduate students. He preferred a solution that ended what he called the \"federal-government monopoly on the student-lending business\", referring to the provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that changed the way the federal government makes student loans.",
        "January 6": "On January 6, 2021, Cotton released a statement repudiating the attack on the Capitol:\nLast summer, as insurrection gripped the streets, I called to send in the troops if necessary to restore order. Today, insurrectionists occupied our Capitol. Fortunately, the Capitol Police and other law-enforcement agencies restored order without the need for federal troops. But the principle remains the same: no quarter for insurrectionists. Those who attacked the Capitol today should face the full extent of federal law.\nHe subsequently repeated his earlier description of those involved as \"insurrectionists\" and said they should be brought to justice.On May 28, 2021, Cotton voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.",
        "Ranked-choice voting": "After Democrat Mary Peltola won the 2022 Alaska's at-large congressional district special election, defeating former Alaska governor and Republican Sarah Palin, Cotton blasted the ranked-choice voting system that Alaska used to conduct its election, writing: \"60% of Alaska voters voted for a Republican, but thanks to a convoluted process and ballot exhaustion\u2014which disenfranchises voters\u2014a Democrat won\".",
        "Foreign policy views": "Cotton, through his foreign policy views, has been characterized as a war hawk.During a February 5, 2015, Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Cotton called for housing more prisoners at Guantanamo Bay instead of closing it. He said of the detainees in the camp, \"every last one them can rot in hell, but as long as they don't do that they can rot in Guantanamo Bay\". The following June, he was one of 21 Senate Republicans to oppose an amendment to the 2016 Defense Authorization Act that would impair any future president's ability to authorize torture. The amendment, which passed, had bipartisan support and was sponsored by John McCain and Dianne Feinstein.In September 2016, Cotton was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to United States secretary of state John Kerry advocating that the United States use \"all available tools to dissuade Russia from continuing its airstrikes in Syria\" from an Iranian airbase near Hamadan \"that are clearly not in our interest\" and stating that there should be clear enforcement by the US of the airstrikes violating \"a legally binding Security Council Resolution\" on Iran.In July 2017, Cotton voted in favor of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that grouped together sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.In July 2017, Cotton co-sponsored the bipartisan Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which amended existing federal law that criminalized foreign-led boycotts of U.S. allies, by specifically prohibiting support to foreign governments or organizations imposing a boycott on Israel. The proposal generated controversy as some interpreted the law as a restriction on activities by private citizens and potentially a violation of constitutional rights. Others viewed it as a clarification of the existing Export Administration Act of 1979 in response to the 2016 United Nations Human Rights Council resolutions that called on corporations to reassess business activities that may impact Palestinian human rights.In December 2018, after Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops in Syria, Cotton was one of six senators to sign a letter expressing concern about the move and their belief \"that such action at this time is a premature and costly mistake that not only threatens the safety and security of the United States, but also emboldens ISIS, Bashar al Assad, Iran, and Russia.\" In January 2019, Cotton was one of 11 Republican senators to vote to advance legislation intended to block Trump's intent to lift sanctions against three Russian companies.In August 2019, it was reported that Cotton had suggested to Trump and the Danish ambassador that the U.S. should buy Greenland. Cotton supports U.S. withdrawal from the Open Skies agreement, which lets nations use special aircraft to monitor each other's military activities. In 2018, he asserted that the agreement was outdated and that it favored Russian interests.",
        "China": "In 2018, Cotton was a cosponsor of the Countering the Chinese Government and Communist Party's Political Influence Operations Act, a bill introduced by Marco Rubio and Catherine Cortez Masto that would grant the U.S. secretary of state and the director of national intelligence (DNI) the authority to create an interagency task force with the purpose of examining attempts by China to influence the U.S. and key allies.In August 2018, Cotton and 16 other lawmakers urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials who are responsible for human rights violations in western China's Xinjiang region targeting the Uyghur ethnic minority. They wrote in a bipartisan letter, \"The detention of as many as a million or more Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in 'political reeducation' centers or camps requires a tough, targeted, and global response\".In February 2019, Cotton was one of the group of Senate Republicans who signed a letter to Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi requesting that Pelosi invite President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen to address a joint meeting of Congress. The request came amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China and was expected to anger Chinese leadership if granted.In May 2019, when asked about the impact of tariffs on farmers in Arkansas, Cotton said there would be \"some sacrifices on the part of Americans, I grant you that, but I also would say that sacrifice is pretty minimal compared to the sacrifices that our soldiers make overseas that are fallen heroes that are laid to rest in Arlington make\", and that farmers were willing to make sacrifices in order for the U.S. to fend off against Chinese attempts to displace the U.S. globally.In May 2019, Cotton was a cosponsor of the South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act, a bipartisan bill reintroduced by Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin that was intended to disrupt China's consolidation or expansion of its claims of jurisdiction over both the sea and air space in disputed zones in the South China Sea.In July 2019, Cotton and Senator Chris Van Hollen were the primary sponsors of the Defending America's 5G Future Act, a bill that would prevent Huawei from being removed from the \"entity list\" of the Commerce Department without an act of Congress and authorize Congress to block administration waivers for U.S. companies to do business with Huawei. The bill would also codify Trump's executive order from the previous May that empowered his administration to block foreign tech companies deemed a national security threat from conducting business in the United States.In April 2020, Cotton said that Chinese students in the United States should be restricted to studying the humanities and banned from studying science-related fields. In an interview with Fox News, he said, \"It is a scandal to me that we have trained so many of the Chinese Communist Party's brightest minds.\"",
        "COVID-19": "On January 28, 2020, in the context of the emergence of COVID-19, Cotton urged the Trump administration to halt commercial flights from China to the United States. On January 31, spurred in part by Cotton's warnings, the Trump administration banned most travel from China.In a February 16, 2020, Fox News interview, Cotton said that the coronavirus may have started at the biosafety level 4 super laboratory in Wuhan, China. \"Now, we don't have evidence that this disease originated there\", Cotton said, \"but because of China's duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning we need to at least ask the question\". Articles published by The New York Times and The Washington Post the same day reported that scientists had dismissed claims that the Chinese government created the virus. The Times said this was because of its resemblance to the SARS virus, which originated with bats. In another interview on Fox the next day, Cotton said of the two articles, \"It tells you the Chinese Communist Party, just like any communist party, has a widespread propaganda effort.\" The Post called Cotton's comments \"debunked\" and \"conspiracy theory\" for 15 months until issuing a correction: \"The term 'debunked' and The Post's use of 'conspiracy theory' have been removed because, then as now, there was no determination about the origins of the virus.\" Molecular biologist Richard Ebright said The Post had omitted his views supporting the lab leak hypothesis and \"materially misrepresented\" his views, adding, \"Watching 'the first rough draft of history' being written as a partisan exercise, rather than a journalistic exercise, was dismaying.\"Cotton tweeted around March 2020: \"we will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\" for what it had done. To a tweet stating \"China will pay for this\", he responded \"Correct.\" In late April 2020, Cotton said in a Fox News interview that the non-containment of the pandemic was a \"deliberate\" and \"malevolent\" attack by Chinese government on the rest of the world. \"They did not want to see their relative power and standing in the world decline because the virus was contained [in China]\", he said.",
        "Iran": "In 2013, Cotton introduced legislative language to prohibit trade with relatives of individuals subject to U.S. sanctions against Iran. According to Cotton, this would include \"a spouse and any relative to the third degree\", such as \"parents, children, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, grandparents, great grandparents, grandkids, great grandkids.\" After Cotton's amendment came under harsh criticism regarding its constitutionality, he withdrew it.In March 2015, Cotton wrote and sent a letter to the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, signed by 47 of the Senate's 54 Republicans, that cast doubt on the Obama administration's authority to engage in nuclear-proliferation negotiations with Iran. The next president, they asserted, could reject it \"with the stroke of a pen\". The open letter was released in English as well as a poorly translated Persian version, which \"read like a middle schooler wrote it\", according to Foreign Policy. Within hours, commentators suggested that the letter prepared by Cotton constituted a violation of the Logan Act. Questions were also raised about whether it reflected a flawed interpretation of the Treaty Clause of the United States Constitution.President Obama mocked the letter, calling it an \"unusual coalition\" with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as well as an interference with the ongoing negotiations of a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program. In addition, Obama said, \"I'm embarrassed for them. For them to address a letter to the Ayatollah\u2014the Supreme Leader of Iran, who they claim is our mortal enemy\u2014and their basic argument to them is: don't deal with our president, 'cause you can't trust him to follow through on an agreement ... That's close to unprecedented.\"Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, responded to the letter by saying \"[the senators'] letter in fact undermines the credibility of thousands of such mere executive agreements that have been or will be entered into by the US with various other governments\". Zarif pointed out that the nuclear deal is not supposed to be an Iran\u2013US deal, but an international one, saying, \"change of administration does not in any way relieve the next administration from international obligations undertaken by its predecessor in a possible agreement about Iran's peaceful nuclear program.\" He continued, \"I wish to enlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with the stroke of a pen, as they boast, it will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law.\"Cotton defended the letter amid criticism that it undermined Obama's efforts, saying, \"It's so important we communicated this message straight to Iran... No regrets at all... they already control Tehran, increasingly they control Damascus and Beirut and Baghdad and now Sana'a as well.\" He continued to defend his action in an interview with MSNBC by saying, \"There are nothing but hardliners in Iran. They've been killing Americans for 35 years. They kill hundreds of troops in Iraq. Now they control five capitals in the Middle East. There are nothing but hardliners in Tehran and if they do all those things without a nuclear weapon, imagine what they'll do with a nuclear weapon.\"Cotton received extensive financial support from pro-Israel groups due to his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and for his hawkish stance toward Iran. Several pro-Israel Republican billionaires who contributed millions of dollars to William Kristol's Emergency Committee for Israel spent $960,000 to support Cotton.In July 2018, Cotton introduced the Iran Hostage Taking Accountability Act, a bill that would call for the president to compose a list of Iranians that were \"knowingly responsible for or complicit in...the politically-motivated harassment, abuse, extortion, arrest, trial, conviction, sentencing, or imprisonment\" of Americans and have those on the list face sanctions along with enabling the president to impose sanctions on their family members and bar them from entering the United States. Cotton stated that Iran had not changed much since 1981 and called for Americans to avoid Iran and its borders as there were \"many friendly countries in the region that you can visit where you'd be safer\".In May 2019, Cotton said that in the event of a war with Iran, the United States could easily win in \"two strikes. The first strike and the last strike\". He said there would be a \"furious response\" by the United States if there was any provocation from Iran.",
        "Russia": "On March 13, 2018, in an interview on conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt's radio show, Cotton said he expected Russian officials to \"lie and deny\" about the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, an ex-Russian spy on British soil. After Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May gave Russia 24 hours to respond to the poison, Cotton said, \"I suspect the response will be the typical Russian response. They\u2019ll lie and deny.\" He went on to suggest retaliatory measures that the U.K. and the U.S. could implement in response to Russia's alleged actions, including renewed sanctions on oil.",
        "Reception": "Former chief presidential strategist Steve Bannon has said of Cotton, \"Next to Trump, he\u2019s the elected official who gets it the most\u2014the economic nationalism. Cotton was the one most supportive of us, up front and behind the scenes, from the beginning. He understands that the Washington \u00e9lite\u2014this permanent political class of both parties, between the K Street consultants and politicians\u2014needs to be shattered\".Cotton has been called one of the leading voices of Trumpism. The Washington Post wrote: \"What's fascinating is how Cotton has adjusted since Trump's victory. Some have argued that Cotton could be the \"heir\" to the Trumpism wing of the Republican Party.",
        "Personal life": "Cotton married attorney Anna Peckham in 2014. They have two children.Cotton has said that Walter Russell Mead, Robert D. Kaplan, Henry Kissinger, Daniel Silva, C. J. Box, and Jason Matthews are among his favorite authors.In 2019, Cotton published a book about the role of the Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetery, partly based on his service in that unit as an officer.",

He is chairman of DataEQ, a leading South African opinion mining company.His former roles include executive chairman of the ATP Tour, president at Walt Disney Television International, chairman of BBC Worldwide, chairman of Virgin Racing F1 team, board member of Kirch/SLEC and ITV, director of Saracens rugby club and CEO of Satbel.",
        "Early life and career": "De Villiers was born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, the son of South African cardiologist Marquard De Villiers. He has three sisters and a brother; record producer Paul, is responsible for the triple platinum Mr. Mister album  Welcome to the Real World.\nAfter graduating with a civil engineering degree from the University of Pretoria, DeVilliers received a Rhodes scholarship and read PPE at Oxford University.

        "Satbel and racial de-segregation in South Africa": "As CEO of Satbel, De Villiers was instrumental in ending racial segregation in South African cinema theatres.  Describing his dealings with former South African president F. W. De Klerk, the then-Minister of Internal Affairs, de Villiers said: \"We bluffed each other that it would be catastrophic if we didn't do the right thing. De Klerk bluffed the government and I bluffed the entertainment industry and together we managed to pull it off.\"",
        "Indian Premier League": "In 2009 De Villiers was asked by his former business partner Lalit Modi to assume ultimate responsibility for promoting the 2009 Indian Premier League in its last-minute switch to South Africa. The IPL was moved less than a month before opening ceremonies were due to begin, following terrorist attacks in India. At the time Modi was quoted as saying: \"It's taken South Africa eight years to get ready for the 2010 soccer World Cup. We've had 29 days\". Moving host nations is reported to have required the short-notice booking of 59 matches in 8 South African stadia, as well as 10,000 air tickets and 30,000 hotel rooms.De Villiers asked Fran\u00e7ois Pienaar to lend his support. The endorsement of the talismanic South African 1995 Rugby World Cup captain is credited with sparking interest in the IPL among South African fans, many of whom had never heard of the visiting Indian city-teams. The Times of India reported that the South African IPL tour did much to boost racial integration and presented South Africa as the perfect sporting destination. Citing the IPL's positive reviews, the Times called the South African tour \"a successful experiment in atypical globalization ... where the West has to look to the East\".",
        "Tenure at the ATP": "In September 2005 De Villiers was appointed chairman of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the governing body of the men's professional tennis circuit. De Villiers was given a brief to modernise men's tennis, a sport that many commentators believed to have grown stagnant and balkanized.While some in the sport took against his reforms, De Villiers' tenure is now viewed more favourably. De Villiers is credited by the Financial Times newspaper with making the sport easier to follow and more entertaining for fans, doubling prize money for players and attracting $1bn of new investment.De Villiers was behind the decision to host the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena. With its more dramatic and theatrical presentation, the O2 event was marketed as a clean break from traditional UK tennis, although both the All England Club and the Lawn Tennis Association helped to publicise it. The inaugural event overcame initial scepticism to register a total attendance of more than 250,000; the venue has hosted all ATP World tour finals to date.De Villiers fulfilled his three-year contract with the ATP in December 2008.",
        "Controversies": "De Villiers' reform of the ATP essentially involved players giving up a degree of autonomy in return for higher potential earnings, and persuading promoters and agents to endorse a more TV-friendly tournament format, sometime at the expense of individual interest groups within the sport.\nSome of De Villiers' decisions were publicly contested by players and promoters, notably Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Inside Tennis magazine reported the position between De Villiers and players thus:\nThe problem for de Villiers is the ATP is a union of multi-millionaire 19-25-year-old kids and they don't want to take orders from a former Disney executive.\nIn March 2008, 20 ATP players signed a letter to the ATP Board of Directors to the effect that De Villiers' contract should not be renewed until other candidates were interviewed for the position. Other players were more approving. In a 2007 Inside Tennis interview, doubles player Mike Bryan said of De Villiers: \"[he] might make a couple of bad calls, but in general the guy's a genius\".The ATP experienced external controversies during De Villiers tenure, most notably an antitrust lawsuit brought by the German Tennis Federation. The lawsuit challenged the ATP's right to downgrade Hamburg's status on the Masters Series, a decision that also reduced the earnings of some clay-court players. Hamburg's case was unanimously rejected by the US jury, but legal victory came at a considerable financial expense to the ATP.Separately, in 2007 several players reported being approached by illegal gambling rings offering money to fix matches. The ATP's subsequent investigation found some players had gambled in contravention of the ATP's rules. Although none had bet on their own matches, five players were fined and suspended.  The much-publicised Davydenko-Arg\u00fcello match in Sopot, where Betfair suspended betting after a series of highly unusual bets, prompted a rethink in the sport.  De Villiers initiated an independent review to investigate whether corruption was systemic within the game. The report called for the establishment of a tennis-wide anti corruption unit, a recommendation that led to the Tennis Integrity Unit, a joint initiative by the ATP, ITF, WTA and the Grand Slam committee. In a 2007 interview with the New York Times, De Villiers said: \"We can't possibly stop our athletes being approached [by illegal gambling rings]. We can't have all of our 700 or 800 athletes with bodyguards, but what we can do is educate them on their responsibilities when they are approached and the consequences of not behaving appropriately.\"A New York Times profile of De Villiers and ATP described him as \"quotable and irreverent\".",
        "BBC Worldwide": "De Villiers was chairman of the BBC's commercial holdings board, including BBC Worldwide, from 2005 to 2009. In de Villiers' last year as chairman the organisation announced revenues exceeding \u00a31 billion for 2008/2009. In 2007/08, BBC Worldwide reported profits of \u00a3120m, up three-fold on 2004/05, with much of the increase coming from international expansion and new businesses.",

He then co-founded the Social Democrats in 2015, becoming joint leader of the new party.

        "Political career": "In October 2012, he addressed Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament, in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, on behalf of the technical group, saying: \"\u20ac67 billion is being borrowed from the troika, virtually all of which is going into the banks and almost the same amount is being given by the banks to the senior bondholders in terms of forgone losses. This is what has happened: there has been a \u20ac67 billion circle of money from the troika through Ireland to the international banks and investors\u2026 I thank Mr. Schulz for his support and I hope he will be able to bring this simple message back: Ireland did not get a bailout and Ireland is not looking for aid or benevolence. We need our money back in order that we can contribute to the recovery of Europe.\"Miriam Lord of The Irish Times made Donnelly her 2012 Politician of the Year, owing to his contributions on the post-2008 Irish banking crisis.",

Upon joining, Donnelly said that he believed Fianna F\u00e1il to be \"the best team that most closely align with my politics who I believe are taking these challenges very seriously\". During a 2017 radio interview, Donnelly was questioned about a previous newspaper column, in which, after paraphrasing an unnamed person about Fianna F\u00e1il's perceived problems and \"lack of accountability\", Donnelly wrote that he \"hate[d] it when the cynics are right\". Donnelly initially said that he did not know where the host was quoting from - later stating: \"I stand corrected\". He was appointed party spokesperson for Brexit. In a Front-Bench reshuffle in March 2018, he was appointed Fianna F\u00e1il spokesperson on health.

        "Drug laws": "In a 2017 interview with Hot Press magazine, Donnelly spoke about smoking cannabis and use of other drugs. When asked whether he had taken drugs other than cannabis, Donnelly responded: \"I have but that's all the detail I'm going to go into\".After being announced as a minister in the 2020 cabinet, Donnelly reportedly stood by his 2017 comments, and noted an openness to the liberalisation of some drug laws, stating that if \"you're doing something that's not harming anybody else, it's hard to see a legitimate role for the State in prosecuting you for it\". A 2020 news article described Donnelly as \"broadly supportive\" of supervised injection centres and open to making cannabis legal.",
        "Minister for Health": "As part of the coalition government of the 33rd D\u00e1il, Donnelly was appointed Minister for Health by Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin on 27 June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. His tenure to date has resulted in several gaffes, most notably when he compared the danger to children from returning to schools during the pandemic to that of jumping on trampolines. He has been criticised for not being on top of his brief, for floating ideas in the media such as a mooted third change in several weeks to Ireland's vaccine rollout plan, and during the height of lockdown, querying why his department's officials weren't retweeting his tweets.On 31 August 2022, Donnelly admitted that he failed to register a rental property in Dublin for three years with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), and only did so after it emerged Fianna F\u00e1il TD Robert Troy had also registered a property late. In a statement, his spokesperson said this was due to \"an oversight\" and had been corrected online \"last week\". Donnelly had declared a south Dublin rental property on the D\u00e1il register of members' interests.On 17 December 2022, he was re-appointed to the same position following Leo Varadkar's appointment as Taoiseach.",

    "Angela Duckworth": {
        "Introduction": "Angela Lee Duckworth (born 1970) is an American academic, psychologist, and popular science author. She is the Rosa Lee and Egbert Chang Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, where she studies grit and self-control. She is also the Founder and CEO of Character Lab, a not-for-profit whose mission is to advance the science and practice of character development.",
        "Life": "Duckworth was born in 1970 to Chinese immigrants. Her father Ying Kao Lee (1933-2020) was a chemist with DuPont and invented Lucite dispersion lacquer. She grew up in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and graduated from Cherry Hill High School East.Duckworth earned a B.A. in Neurobiology at Harvard College in 1992. She then graduated from the University of Oxford in 1996 with an M.Sc. in neuroscience on a Marshall Scholarship, and from the University of Pennsylvania in 2006 with a Ph.D. in psychology. She was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2013.After obtaining a master's degree, Duckworth was a management consultant at McKinsey & Company. She quit about a year later to become a math teacher at Lowell High School (San Francisco).Duckworth's first book, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, was released in May 2016. It stayed on The New York Times bestseller list for 21 weeks. A review of the book in The New York Times called Duckworth \"the psychologist who has made 'grit' the reigning buzzword in education-policy circles.\"Duckworth is currently the co-host of the podcast No Stupid Questions on the Freakonomics network.",
        "Grit": "Duckworth is best known for her research on grit, a strength she defines as passion and perseverance for long-term goals. She developed the Grit Scale, a measure of this construct.Duckworth has found grit to be a common factor among the high-achievers she has studied. Her work suggests that grit is unrelated to IQ but is closely related to conscientiousness. Grit has been studied across the lifespan, but Duckworth focuses primarily on how building grit can help adolescents. This falls under the umbrella of character education and the movement to expand school instruction beyond solely cognitive factors.\nSince the introduction of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015, there has been a growing call for effective ways to measure character strengths. However, Duckworth herself has encouraged caution when applying and, especially, testing character in classrooms. One reason is that existing measures were designed for scientific purposes, and so as yet there are no reliable ways to measure grit in high-stakes situations, like college admissions or job applications.Some claim that focusing on grit would lead to the neglect of other important factors, like the positive socio-economic prerequisites necessary to deploy it. Duckworth has acknowledged the importance of environmental factors, saying that it's not that one matters more than the other but rather that they both matter: \"The question is not whether we should concern ourselves with grit or structural barriers to achievement. In the most profound sense, both are important, and more than that, they are intertwined.\"Grit has had its share of critics. A 2017 meta-analysis found that \"grit is only moderately correlated with performance and retention,\" and that it had not been adequately distinguished from several previously studied constructs, including conscientiousness, persistence, and industriousness. In a 2021 article, Duckworth acknowledged that she had misinterpreted the psychometric properties of her Grit scale."

    "John Elliott (businessman)": {
        "Introduction": "John Dorman Elliott (3 October 1941 \u2013 23 September 2021) was an Australian businessman and state and federal president of the Liberal Party. He had also been president of the Carlton Football Club. He frequently provoked controversy due to his political affiliations, his brushes with the law, and his abrasive personal style.",
        "Early life and education": "Elliott was born in Melbourne on 3 October 1941. He was the son of Frank Elliott and his wife, Anita. He completed his secondary schooling at Carey Baptist Grammar School in Kew. He then attended the University of Melbourne and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce (Hons) degree and later completed a Master of Business Administration degree at the Melbourne Business School.",
        "Career": "Elliott joined BHP for two years. He then left to do an MBA, before joining global consulting firm McKinsey & Company in 1966 and worked in both Australia and the United States for six years. In 1972, he acquired control of IXL, a food manufacturer listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. From there, he and his team built the company up through a string of acquisitions throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, including Australian corporate icons Elders Limited (an agricultural services concern) and Carlton & United Breweries (now part of the Foster's Group). The acquisition of Courage Breweries in the United Kingdom, followed by Carling O'Keefe Breweries in Canada- and UK-based Grand Metropolitan Breweries, made the Foster's Group the fourth-largest brewer in the world. During this time, he was also a high-profile president of the Carlton Football Club (1983\u20132002) and federal president of the Liberal Party. He was an effective advocate for the club on a range of issues. During his presidency, the club won two VFL (now AFL) premierships.In 1985, Elliott's company, by then called Elders IXL, played an important role as a white knight in fending off Robert Holmes \u00e0 Court's attempted takeover of diversified mining company BHP. Elders bought a large share in BHP, which blocked Holmes \u00e0 Court's attempt to take control. As a result, Elliott joined the BHP board. He then attempted a management buyout of Elders, but this was unsuccessful and left his A$80 million fortune considerably reduced.\nSubsequently, the National Crime Authority of Australia (NCA) investigated a foreign exchange transaction undertaken by Elders. Elliott was cleared of criminal charges. He accused the NCA of a vendetta inspired by the then-Labor government, motivated by his position as Liberal Party president. He later launched civil action for damages, which was ultimately unsuccessful.He was also a director of a number of public companies, including BHP, National Mutual, Bridge Oil and North Limited. Elliott was a member of the Liberal Party for over thirty years. He held multiple positions in the party, including president (1987\u20131990), party treasurer and vice president of the Victorian division. He was chairman of the 500 Club, which he formed in the 1980s, and was the biggest donor to the Liberal Party in Victoria.His various political involvements led to him being caricatured in Rubbery Figures, a satirical rubber puppet series that screened in Australia during the late 1980s. He was often depicted holding an Elders IXL beer can while belching or exclaiming \"pig's arse\".In 1990, Elliott was a vocal supporter of the Multifunction Polis (MFP), a controversial concept to build in Australia a new \"technology city\" with a population of 100,000. At the time, the leader of the Liberal Party, Andrew Peacock, was vehemently opposed to the plan, claiming the Multifunction Polis would become an \"Asian enclave\".",

        "Carlton Football Club President": "Elliott became the president of the Carlton Football Club in 1983, when he replaced Ian Rice.

Elliott also oversaw Carlton's two premiership victories in 1987 and 1995.After the 2002 AFL season, Elliott was voted out of office as president of the Carlton Football Club, a position he had held for two decades. The club, after having finished last for the first time since 1894, was later found to have committed serious long-term breaches of the Australian Football League salary cap regulations, which resulted in a fine of $930,000, forfeited draft picks including the prized number one draft pick, and an ongoing prolonged period of poor results on the field. Further, in a move some thought to be ungracious given his long service to the club, his name was also removed from all signage at Carlton's home ground at Princes Park. Elliott was then replaced by Ian Collins as President of Carlton Football Club.",
        "Later life": "In January 2005, he declared himself bankrupt, to be discharged in July 2008.On television, Elliott was a regular guest panelist on the ABC television program Q&A. In 2010, he appeared on the televised Dick Smith population debate, where his vision to harness Northern Australia's excess rainfall via pipeline to the Murray\u2013Darling headwaters in Queensland received wide support. \nIn 2012, he featured on the ABC's Agony Uncles program. On radio, he regularly appeared on a program presented by his son Tom on talkback station 3AW.Elliott was the inaugural chairman of the Committee for Melbourne and a director of the foundation of the University of Melbourne Business School. In September 2015, he was made an honorary fellow of the school.",
        "Personal life": "He was divorced from the late Lorraine Elliott, a former Victorian state parliamentarian for the Liberal Party. They had three children. The eldest is Tom Elliott (born 1967), an investment banker and radio and television presenter. His daughter Caroline Elliott is vice-president of the Liberal Party in Victoria. He also had two children from his second marriage, which also ended in divorce. His second wife, Amanda Elliott, later became the first female chairperson in the Victorian Racing Club's 153-year history.Known for his \"eccentric, crass and often controversial style of business and politics\", Elliott was also a long-term cigarette smoker and claimed to have considered running for the 2016 Australian Senate on a platform of \"Smokers' Rights\".Elliott was admitted to the Epworth Hospital in Richmond, Victoria after suffering a fall in September 2021.

One of these is \"Asian economies which are...generating significant surpluses.\"Farrell has stated that she would like to see more alumni of the corporate sector serving in government, stating in an interview that \"This is my first time serving in government \u2014 I came from the private sector \u2014 and I just think it is a fantastic thing for people to do, for people in the private sector to serve in government, to serve their country, and to really understand what a very large fraction of the economy and society is all about and how this works.\"\nFollowing the 2008 financial crisis, Farrell argued that governments had \"overextended themselves\" in the aftermath of the recession and called for \"structural reforms\" in an October 2012 interview.Farrell is a supporter of regulation of large banks.  In an interview with National Public Radio, she stated: \"We have created them, and we're sort of past that point, and I think that in some sense, the genie's out of the bottle and what we need to do is to manage them and to oversee them, as opposed to hark back to a time that we're unlikely to ever come back to or want to come back to.\"",

Foley received the Department of Defense Distinguished Public Service Award in June 2004 for his service in Iraq.From October 2006 to January 2009, Foley was the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland, appointed by President George W. Bush. Foley served as ambassador at a time when U.S. foreign policy was unpopular in Ireland. He directed his public diplomacy efforts mostly toward an improved understanding of U.S. foreign policy goals and shared interests with Ireland.Foley worked with Robert Tuttle, U.S. Ambassador to the U.K., and special envoy Paula Dobriansky to re-establish the devolved government in Northern Ireland under the Good Friday Agreement and to stimulate investment there. He was present in Belfast on May 8, 2007, when the new government of Northern Ireland was sworn in.As ambassador, Foley hosted a conference on green technology in Galway and another in Dublin on philanthropy, bringing together experts from the U.S. and their Irish counterparts.  He was active in promoting cultural exchange by arranging visits from prominent Irish American artists and performers including Conan O'Brien and former U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins.\nIn its endorsement of Foley for the 2010 Connecticut governor's race, the Irish Voice said, \"Foley is a former Ambassador to Ireland who performed great service there and is fondly remembered.\"",
        "2010 gubernatorial campaign": "In June, 2009, Foley announced that he would run for the U.S. Senate in 2010 against incumbent Christopher Dodd. However, following the surprise announcement by Republican governor Jodi Rell that she would not seek a second term, Foley announced on December 3, 2009, that he was leaving the Senate race to run for Governor of Connecticut.On May 22, 2010, Foley received the Republican Party's endorsement at the state convention. Two other candidates, Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele and Simsbury businessman Nelson \"Oz\" Griebel, also received sufficient support from delegates to qualify for an August 10, 2010, primary.\nIn the August 10 state Republican primary, Foley defeated challengers Fedele and Griebel to become the official Republican candidate for governor in 2010.\nIn the general election, Foley ran against Democrat Dannel Malloy, the former mayor of Stamford. Foley ran on a platform emphasizing his executive and problem-solving experience in the private sector and that he was not a career politician. Early in the campaign he published a \"Plan Forward for Connecticut\" outlining what he would do to solve Connecticut's biggest problems, including bringing more jobs to the state and closing Connecticut's large budget deficit. Foley also promoted an aggressive plan to improve Connecticut's underperforming inner-city schools.\nThe New London Day said in their endorsement of Foley, that \"he is best suited for the job at hand. The challenges confronting the next governor do not appear to intimidate him. He is pragmatic about what needs to be fixed.\"The New Haven Register also endorsed Foley, described him as \"the more forthright of the two candidates\", and stated that \"Foley's record as a business executive is commendable.  His business skills in increasing productivity while keeping an eye on cost are needed in the governor's office.\"In the general election for governor, Foley received 560,874 votes (48.95%), just short of Democrat Dan Malloy's 567,278 (49.50%) tally, a difference of fewer than 6,500 votes. After nearly a week of uncertainty about the actual vote tally from Bridgeport and several other towns, he conceded defeat on Monday, November 8. Ultimately, Foley spent $11 million of his own money on the race.",
        "2014 gubernatorial campaign": "Foley won the Republican nomination for governor on May 17, 2014, securing more than 57% of the delegates. He faced Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton and Senate Minority Leader John McKinney of Fairfield in the August primary. Foley said that he and McKinney, his main rival, agreed to forgo any negative campaigning during the primary to avoid weakening the Republicans' general election candidate, and then later accused McKinney of violating that pledge when the campaign took a negative turn. On June 3, 2014, Foley announced that he would accept public financing.On August 12, 2014, Foley won the primary against McKinney by almost 10,000 votes, winning in every county.In the general election, Foley promised to solve Connecticut's fiscal crisis without raising taxes. He said he would reduce unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens on employers to stimulate job growth and would reduce the car tax in the state's largest cities.  Foley's pledge not to raise taxes forced Governor Malloy to do make the same pledge, but within nine months of the election Governor Malloy signed a bill significantly raising Connecticut taxes both on individuals and businesses.Foley was criticized by his opponent for paying no federal income tax for 2011 and 2012 and only $673 for 2013. He explained that he typically has no taxable personal income unless one of the companies he owns is sold at a profit, which had not happened in those years. In the 2010 campaign, Foley released tax returns showing he paid federal and state taxes in 2008 and 2009 exceeding $800,000.\nIn July 2014, Foley gave a press conference criticizing Malloy outside Fusion Paperboard, a paper mill that had just been closed by its owners. Foley defended the owners' decision to close the plant and told the local first selectman and several union leaders, \"You want to blame people who are hundreds or thousands of miles away, malign management. Listen, you have failed, because you have lost these jobs.\" He said that Malloy was to blame because of \"anti-business policies... things like mandatory sick leave, raising energy costs, uhhh, just the negative signals he sends out.\"Foley's Democratic opponents in the general election initially tried to draw attention to a car accident Foley had in 1981. The state Democratic Party Communications Director who was leading the effort to attract attention to the accident was let go in early 2014 and Foley's opponents\u2019 primary messaging switched to Foley's wealth and that he was out of touch with workers.The campaign rhetoric between the two candidates was acrimonious. Foley lost the general election to incumbent Dannel Malloy, 507,544 (48.1%) to 537,017 (50.9%).",
        "After 2014": "Foley endorsed Chris Christie in the 2016 Republican primaries.",
        "Personal life": "In 1994, at the age of 42, Foley was suddenly afflicted with Bell's palsy. The condition partly paralyzed the right side of his face. Foley can only smile with the left side of his mouth; his right eye is partially closed.In 2009, Foley married Leslie Fahrenkopf, who was 41 and vice president for global ethics and compliance and an associate general counsel at News Corporation in New York City at the time of their wedding. From 2003 to 2008, Fahrenkopf had been an associate counsel to President George W. Bush in the Office of White House Counsel.  Foley has a son Tom, Jr. (born October 25, 1990) and he and Leslie have boy and girl twins, Grace Quinlan and William Reed (born September 26, 2011)."

        "Introduction": "Jane Fraser (born 1967) is a British-American banking executive and the chief executive (CEO) of Citigroup, a position she has held since March 2021. Educated at Girton College, Cambridge, and Harvard Business School, she was a partner at McKinsey & Company for 10 years before joining Citigroup in 2004. In 2019, she was named president of Citigroup, and also CEO of Consumer Banking.In September 2020, Citigroup announced that she would replace Michael Corbat as CEO of Citigroup Inc. in February 2021, becoming the first woman to head a major U.S. bank. She was included on Fortune's \"Most Powerful Women in Business\" list in 2014 and 2015 and has been called the \"Number 1 Woman to Watch\" for two consecutive years by American Banker.",
        "Early life and education": "Jane Fraser was born in St Andrews, Scotland. She attended Girton College, Cambridge, from 1985 to 1988, graduating with an BA (promoted to a MA per tradition) in economics.After graduation, she worked as a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Goldman Sachs, London, from July 1988 to July 1990, then as a brokerage associate for Asesores Burs\u00e1tiles, a Madrid-based securities broker, from August 1990 to June 1992. In 1992 she enrolled at Harvard Business School, earning her MBA in 1994.",
        "McKinsey & Company": "In 1994 she joined McKinsey & Company, working in financial services and global strategy, eventually rising to partner. For the first six years she worked in New York, and for the last four years in London. She worked part-time while raising her young children.She wrote articles on globalization and was a co-author, with three other McKinsey employees, of the 1999 book Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm. As part of her research for the book, she traveled to China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, and India to interview McKinsey clients about their global challenges. After hearing her speak about the book, Citigroup executive Michael Klein spent several years encouraging Fraser to make the move to Citigroup, which she eventually did in 2004.",
        "Citigroup": "Fraser was hired as Head of Client Strategy in Citigroup's investment and global banking division in July 2004. In October 2007 she was promoted to Global Head of Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions, a position she held until May 2009. Her tenure as Global Head coincided with the financial crisis of 2007\u20132009, and she was part of the executive team that was \"charged with restructuring the group, leading its re-engineering effort, making divestments and raising new capital\".\n\nIn June 2009 she was named CEO of Citi Private Bank. At the time of her promotion, the bank was running an annual deficit of approximately $250 million; it returned to the black during her four-year tenure. Among the changes she implemented were a decrease in the ratio of private bankers to clients, with a target of one banker for every 30 clients, and the removal of commissions and sales formulas for bankers in favor of a year-end discretionary bonus.In May 2013 she was asked to replace the retiring CEO of CitiMortgage. Though she knew the move was a career risk, she accepted the challenge. Her stewardship of Citigroup's mortgage division coincided with the marketwide drop in demand for mortgage refinancing, forcing the bank to refocus its efforts on selling residential mortgages to home buyers. Citigroup closed several mortgage offices nationwide and laid off 1,000 employees in September 2013 alone.Less than a year later, in March 2014, Fraser was promoted to CEO of US Consumer and Commercial Banking, succeeding Cecelia Stewart who announced her retirement. And in April 2015 she was named CEO of Citigroup Latin America, with responsibility for operations in 24 countries. The latter promotion followed a reshuffling of Citigroup executives sparked by the retirement of Manuel Medina-Mora, CEO of Citigroup's global consumer bank. Medina-Mora was replaced by Stephen Bird, former CEO for the Asia-Pacific region, who in turn was replaced by Francisco Aristeguieta, former CEO of Citigroup Latin America. While based in Miami, Fraser has been tasked with, among other things, \"instilling a more U.S.-like culture\" at Banamex (Banco Nacional de M\u00e9xico), owned and operated by Citigroup since 2001. The bank was fined $2.2 million on fraud charges in 2014. The head of Banamex, Ernesto Torres Cantu, reports directly to Fraser.In October 2019, Fraser was appointed President of Citigroup and Head of Global Consumer Banking (GCB), and was responsible for all of Citi\u2019s Consumer businesses, including Retail Banking and Wealth Management, Credit Cards, Mortgage and Operations and Technology in 19 markets.",

    "Lou Gerstner": {
        "Introduction": "Louis Vincent Gerstner Jr. (born March 1, 1942) is an American businessman, best known for his tenure as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of IBM from April 1993 until 2002, when he retired as CEO in March and chairman in December. He is largely credited with turning IBM's fortunes around.Gerstner was formerly CEO of RJR Nabisco, and also held senior positions at American Express and McKinsey & Company. He is a graduate of Chaminade High School (1959), Dartmouth College (1963) and holds an MBA from the Harvard Business School.\nCurrently, Gerstner is the chairman of the board of directors of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and chairman of the board of the Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.Gerstner is the author of Who Says Elephants Can't Dance, the best-selling account of IBM's transformation; and he is the co-author of the book Reinventing Education: Entrepreneurship in America's Public Schools.",
        "American Express": "Lou Gerstner joined American Express in 1978 and, under his leadership, the company's market share increased significantly by 1985. He achieved this by finding new uses and users for the card, such as college students, physicians, and women, as well as persuading corporations to adopt the card as a more effective way of tracking business expenses. He also created exclusive versions of the card for higher-end clients, such as the Gold Card and the Platinum Card.\nAs sales and profits rebounded, Gerstner was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer of AmEx's Travel Related Services in 1982, and president of the parent company in 1985. Although he claimed the position at the age of 43, Gerstner dismissed the speculation that his success was the product of being a workaholic. Gerstner told Leslie Wayne, \"I hear that and I can't accept that. A workaholic can't take vacations and I take four weeks a year.\"As chairman and chief executive officer of the Travel Related Services division, Gerstner spearheaded its successful \"membership has its privileges\" promotion. Not only was the division continually the most profitable in the company, but it also led the entire financial services industry. Despite these successes, Gerstner hit a ceiling at American Express, as chief executive James D. Robinson III was not expected to retire for another 12 years. During Gerstner's 11-year tenure at American Express, membership had increased from 8.6 million to 30.7 million. He left AmEx in 1989 to succeed Ross Johnson as chairman and chief executive officer of RJR Nabisco following its $25 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.",
        "IBM": "Gerstner was hired as chairman and CEO of IBM in April 1993.  The company's board had forced his predecessor John Akers to resign, looking first within the computer industry for his successor. However Apple's John Sculley, Motorola chairman George Fisher, and Bill Gates of Microsoft were not interested (other rumored candidates included Eckhard Pfeiffer of Compaq and Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems). IBM then turned to Gerstner, an outsider with a record that suggested success whose older brother Richard had run the company's PC division until retiring due to health issues four years earlier. Gerstner was the first IBM CEO who was hired from outside the company.\nUpon becoming chief executive of IBM, Gerstner declared: \"the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision\", as he instead focused on execution, decisiveness, simplifying the organization for speed, and breaking the gridlock. Many expected heads to roll, yet Gerstner initially changed only the CFO, the HR chief, and three key line executives.In his memoir, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?, he describes his arrival at the company in April 1993, when an active plan was in place to dis-aggregate the company. The prevailing wisdom of the time held that IBM's core mainframe business was headed for obsolescence. The company's own management was in the process of allowing its various divisions to rebrand and manage themselves \u2014 the so-called \"Baby Blues.\"  Then-CEO John Akers decided that the logical and rational solution was to split IBM into autonomous business units (such as processors, storage, software, services, printers,) that could compete more effectively with competitors that were more focused and agile and had lower cost structures. Gerstner reversed this plan, realizing from his previous experiences at RJR and American Express that there remained a vital need for a broad-based information technology integrator. He discovered that the biggest problem that all major companies faced in 1993 was integrating all the separate computing technologies that were emerging at the time, and saw that IBM's unique competitive advantage was its ability to provide integrated solutions for customers \u2013 a company that could represent more than piece parts or components\u2014something he only learned by going beyond just listening to the proponents of different technologies within IBM. His choice to keep the company together was the defining decision of his tenure, as these gave IBM the capabilities to deliver complete IT solutions to customers. Services could be sold as an add-on to companies that had already bought IBM computers, while barely profitable pieces of hardware were used to open the door to more profitable deals.One of the strategic visions that Gerstner set for IBM in 1993 was to make e-business its heart and soul. He believed in the potential of B2B e-commerce and wanted to expand the application of the internet to more than just web-page browsing and consumer marketing. He argued that a network-centric approach would shift the workload from personal computers to larger enterprise-systems and allow the internet to be embedded into all aspects of business operations. IBM's initial vision for how e-business could transform the world included electronic debit services that would allow customers to place orders online and eventually shop at virtual stores, creating virtual databases of movies, books, and music that would be available from anywhere in the world, and more. Soon after, Gerstner announced e-business as IBM's growth strategy and formed the IBM Internet Division, led by Irving Wladawsky-Berger. In 1996, IBM's marketing department established the term e-business for any kind of business or commercial transaction conducted over the internet. Under Gerstner, e-business transformed IBM and within six years, they became the market leader in providing the products and services needed to transform any of their customers businesses into a network-centric e-business.While IBM had been credited with turning the personal computer (PC) into a mainstream product, the company could no longer monopolize its market. A proliferation of cheaper IBM-compatible PC clones that used the same Intel chips and Microsoft operating system software simply undercut it and eroded market share. Outgoing IBM chairman and CEO Akers, a company lifer, was excessively immersed in its corporate culture, remaining loyal to traditional ways that masked the real threats. As an outsider, Gerstner had no emotional attachment to long-suffering products IBM had developed to try to regain control of the PC market. Gerstner wrote that in spite of OS/2's technical superiority to the dominant Microsoft Windows 3.0, his colleagues were \"unwilling or unable to accept\" that it was a \"resounding defeat\" as it \"was draining tens of millions of dollars, absorbing huge chunks of senior management's time, and making a mockery of our image\". By the end of 1994, IBM ceased new development of OS/2 software. IBM withdrew from the retail desktop PC market entirely, which had become unprofitable due to price pressures in the early 2000s. Three years after Gerstner's 2002 retirement, IBM sold the PC division to Lenovo.In his memoir, Gerstner described the turnaround as difficult and often wrenching for an IBM culture that had become insular and balkanized. After he arrived, over 100,000 employees were laid off from a company that had maintained a lifetime employment practice from its inception. Long allowed by their managers to believe that employment security had little reference to performance, thousands of IBM employees had grown lax, while the top-performing employees complained bitterly in attitude surveys. In the goal to create one common brand message for all IBM products and services around the world, under Gerstner's leadership the company consolidated its many advertising agencies down to just Ogilvy & Mather. Layoffs and other tough management measures continued in the first two years of his tenure, but the company was saved, and business success has continued to grow steadily since then.From 1993 to Gerstner's retirement in 2002, IBM's market capitalization rose from $29 billion to $168 billion. Despite his success Gerstner also presided over the company's decline, relative to newer rivals, as it lost its once-dominant position in the IT industry. Microsoft grew beyond just PC software in the 1990s, hardware companies Apple and Dell expanded their market share, and entirely new entities such as the Google search engine emerged and created new computer-based business empires. Gerstner was also the first highly-paid IBM CEO relative to his home-grown predecessors, earning a personal fortune of hundreds of millions in his role. His philosophy, quoted as \"The importance of managers being aligned with shareholders\u2014not through risk-free instruments like stock options, but through the process of putting their own money on the line through direct ownership of the company\u2014became a critical part of the management philosophy I brought to IBM\" has been criticized for IBM's management in the late 2000s becoming \"fully isolated and immune from the long-term consequences of their decisions\".",
        "Post-IBM": "In January 2003, Gerstner assumed the position of chairman of The Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C. global private equity firm. He served as chairman from January 2003 until October 2008 and upon retiring from that position, he continued as a senior advisor to Carlyle through September 2016.\nGerstner held the position of chairman of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard from January 2013 - through May 2021.Gerstner established the Gerstner Family Foundation in 1989 and serves as the chairman.

Dodge Medal for Distinguished Service to Education - Teachers College, Columbia University, and the Distinguished Service to Science and Education award from the American Museum of Natural History. In 2008, Gerstner received the Legend in Leadership Award from the Yale School of Management."

    "George N. Gillett Jr.": {
        "Introduction": "George Nield Gillett Jr. (born October 22, 1938) is an American businessman. Originally from Wisconsin, he lives in Vail, Colorado.",
        "Biography": "Gillett graduated from Lake Forest Academy in 1956. He attended Amherst College and is a 1961 graduate of Dominican College of Racine, Wisconsin. Gillett's first job following college was with Crown Zellerbach as regional sales manager. \nGillett's career continued in the 1960s in marketing and management consulting, initially with McKinsey & Co. A sports fanatic since childhood, by 1966, he was business manager and partner of the Miami Dolphins. In 1966, he purchased a 20% interest in the Miami Dolphins NFL franchise for $1 million. He sold this interest in 1968 for $3 million, and used some of the proceeds to purchase the nearly defunct Harlem Globetrotters and later started Globetrotters Communications, a nationally syndicated radio group. He reinvigorated the Globetrotters by an intense marketing effort that included a popular cartoon series.\nIn 1978, Gillett bought Packerland(uncertain if this is the right Packerland). With the successful venture of Packerland, Gillett then diversified into radio and television with the start of Gillett Communications Company. At its peak, Gillett Communications owned network affiliates, the majority of which were CBS, in many of the country's major television markets.\nIn 1979, he launched Gillett Communications by buying three small television stations. Three years later he bought the WSM television station in Nashville. In 1984, Gillett acquired Appleton-based Post Corporation's eight television stations, 22 newspapers and associated plants; the non-broadcast assets were sold to Thomson Corporation and other buyers. In 1986, he bought out the two A.S. Abell stations as part of a spin-off resulting from the acquisition of A.S. Abell by Times Mirror Company. In 1987, he acquired Storer Broadcasting using Kohlberg Kravis Roberts junk bonds, after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lifted restrictions on ownership. The Gillett stations were subsequently spun off to Busse Broadcasting, a company formed by Gillett employees.In 1985, Gillett acquired Vail Associates' Vail and Beaver Creek ski resorts. He would often ride chairlifts and greet guests, and launched a massive installation of high-speed detachable chairlifts. Gillett also supported major alpine ski events at a time when most ski areas in America declined to host international races, starting with the 1989 World Alpine Ski Championships, and through his support hosted the 1999 World Alpine Ski Championships.Gillett's companies sought Chapter 11 protection in 1992, as higher interest rates penalised junk bond issuers. Gillett's media arm was reorganized as SCI Television, shortly before being purchased by New World Communications under the control of Ronald Perelman. Many of these stations would eventually be sold to News Corporation and become owned-and-operated stations carrying Fox.",
        "After junk bonds": "Gillett walked away with $32.1 million to restart his business empire when Vail floated on the NYSE. In 1995, he repurchased Packerland undertaken by Booth Creek Management Corp., a company created to oversee the acquisitions and management of interests of the Gillett family from that point forwards, and of which Gillett remains chairman.\nIn 1996, he formed Booth Creek Ski Holdings Inc., acquiring or building a range of ski resorts in New Hampshire, California, Washington and Wyoming. He later bought Grand Targhee Ski and Summer Resort, together with several golf courses. Booth Creek continues to operate Sierra-at-Tahoe.From 1997, he extended his meat interests by building Corporate Brand Foods America (which included ITC, Iowa Ham, Jordan Meats and Wright Bacon). Iowa Beef Processors (IBP) purchased the company for US$550 million in 1999.\nGillett and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst then bought ConAgra's beef operations \u2013 Swift & Company \u2013 for US$1.4 billion in 2000. On July 12, 2007, JBS S.A., the largest beef processor in South America and one of the largest worldwide beef exporters, purchased Swift & Company in a US$1.5 billion all-cash deal. The acquisition made the newly consolidated JBS Swift Group the largest beef processor in the world.\nIn the meat business, Gillett now also formally controlled:\n\nPetaluma Poultry \u2013 natural and organic chicken products\nSnowball Foods \u2013 food processor of turkey and chicken products\nKings Delight \u2013 food processor of turkey and chicken products\nB3R Country Meats \u2013 processes fresh and frozen natural beef\nColeman Natural Products \u2013 processes fresh and frozen natural pork products and lamb\nGerhard's Napa Valley Sausage \u2013 a producer of gourmet sausage products made primarily from poultry.",
        "North American sports interests": "In 2000, Gillett joined forces with Pat Bowlen and John Elway in a failed attempt to buy the Denver Nuggets of the NBA, Colorado Avalanche of the NHL, and Pepsi Center. On January 2, 2001, Gillett bought an 80% interest in the Montreal Canadiens and their home arena, Molson Centre, for US$185 million. Prior to the purchase, Gillett had shown interest in the Florida Panthers, New York Islanders, Ottawa Senators, and the Phoenix Coyotes. Gillett's bid initially raised fears that he might move the NHL's oldest franchise to the United States. However, after no other viable offers surfaced from Canadian interests, Molson agreed to Gillett's offer. Molson, however, maintained the right of first refusal should Gillett ever sell the team.\nOn August 6, 2007, Gillett bought a controlling interest of the NASCAR team Evernham Motorsports from founder Ray Evernham, thereby forming Gillett Evernham Motorsports. In January 2009, a merger was completed with fellow NASCAR team Petty Enterprises. As a result, GEM was renamed Richard Petty Motorsports. Gillett sold his share in the team after the 2010 season.On March 27, 2008, Joey Saputo, chairman of USL First Division team Montreal Impact, confirmed talks with Gillett and Major League Soccer for a Montreal franchise. While a bid for a franchise was launched with Saputo and Gillett co-heading the venture, as a result of finances, however, the team would rescind the bid later that year on November 22.On June 20, 2009, the Montreal Canadiens confirmed that Gillett had sold the team, along with the Bell Centre and the Gillett Entertainment Group, a Canadian-based sports and entertainment promoter, to the Molson brothers for a reported $550 million (Cdn). The deal was concluded on December 1, 2009.",
        "Liverpool F.C.": "Since October 2006, Gillett and fellow American Tom Hicks had been parties interested in a proposed takeover of Liverpool F.C. of the Premier League. In January 2007, Reports stated that Gillett had made another bid for Liverpool. On January 31, 2007, Dubai International Capital announced they had pulled out of the deal, giving Gillett the opportunity to buy the club from David Moores. On February 2, 2007, Gillett and Hicks reached a deal with the club's board, which was sealed on February 6, thought to be worth in the region of \u00a3435 million: \u00a3220 million to buy out existing shareholders (including approximately \u00a344.8 million of debt), and \u00a3215 million for the new stadium proposed at nearby Stanley Park. The Board unanimously recommended that the club's shareholders accept this offer.\nOn January 22, 2008, a majority of Liverpool fans, at the game between Liverpool and Aston Villa, protested against Gillett and Hicks' running of the club, urging the pair to sell their shares in Liverpool F.C. to Dubai International Capital (DIC). Neither owner, nor their representative Foster Gillett were present at the game. Gillett was reportedly targeted by DIC to sell his shares. It was reported that he has fallen out with Tom Hicks and in recent months has kept silent over his dealing with the club. On March 7, 2008, it was reported that Gillett had agreed to sell 98 per cent of his Liverpool stock to DIC, but Hicks blocked the sale. In an interview on Prime Time Sports in Canada, Gillett revealed that he and his family had received death threats from angry Liverpool fans: \"The fans don\u2019t want him [Tom Hicks] to have even one share of my stake in the club, based on what they are sending to me. As a result of that we [my family] have received many phone calls in the middle of the night threatening our lives, death threats. A number came to the office and my son, Foster, and daughter-in-law, Lauren, have received them.\" The relationship between Gillett and Hicks broke down some time ago, leading to in-fighting at Anfield.It has been reported that former manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez's relationship with Hicks and Gillett had become increasingly strained and he was fired on June 2, 2010, after a poor season which saw the club finish seventh in the Premier League, missing out on UEFA Champions League football for the following season.As of October 15, 2010, Gillett had lost ownership of Liverpool F.C., and despite numerous attempts to prevent it, the club was sold to New England Sports Ventures (NESV), for a fee believed to be around \u00a3300M which was far below his valuation of \"between \u00a3600M and \u00a31 billion (B)\", by the Liverpool F.C. board of directors in a 3\u20132 vote.\nAs of November 2010, Gillett was personally named in a lawsuit filed by Mill Financial, seeking $117 million. Mill Financial, based in Springfield, Virginia, reportedly refinanced a loan used by Gillett to buy a big stake in Liverpool F.C. in 2007. Gillett's partner in the deal was Tom Hicks. Gillett and Hicks, dba Gillett Football LLC, lost control of Liverpool F.C. after they were unable to stop the Royal Bank of Scotland, which financed their original purchase of the team, from selling Liverpool F.C. The bank sold Liverpool F.C. to Boston Red Sox owner John W. Henry\u2019s New England Sports Ventures at a price that was lower than expected. At the same time the Liverpool issue was occurring, Gillett's Richard Petty Motorsports fell into financial trouble.\nOn January 11, 2013, Hicks and Gillett finally decided to drop their case in the English law courts against Sir Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre, the three directors on the board of Liverpool F.C. at the time of the sale of the club to NESV. They also agreed to drop their case against NESV and RBS Bank. The terms of the agreement are confidential, though it is believed that no monies were paid to Hicks or Gillett. Earlier in the week, Hicks and Gillett had lost a Court of Appeal bid to delay a High Court trial, so they could have more time to raise the monies needed to fund the multimillion-pound lawsuit.As of 2016, Gillett is still paying \u00a31.5 million per year in interest payments to Mill Financial, who lent him \u00a350 million for his failed investment in Liverpool.",

Goodall once said \"Including nuclear power in this mix will make a low-carbon and energy-secure future easier to achieve.\" However, he opposed the construction of the Hinkley C nuclear power plant.More recently, Goodall has changed his position on nuclear and his analysis has focused on how the UK can move to a future powered by 100% renewables. This is evident from his Carbon Commentary blog and his 2020 book,What we Need to Do Now  (Page 17: 'My proposal for our route to zero carbon emissions is for a twenty-fold expansion of renewable energy', page 37: 'A few years ago, we might have thought that new nuclear generators might fill the role of renewables today. But the experience around the world of building new power stations has been almost uniformly disastrous' and page 37: 'At today's expected price levels, nuclear power would be at least twice the cost of offshore wind or solar').\nGoodall helped develop the UK's first employee-owned solar PV installation in 2011 at the Eden Project.

        "Early life": "James P. Gorman was born in Melbourne, Australia. He is one of 12 children, two of who have passed away. He was educated at Xavier College, and earned his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws from the University of Melbourne, where he was a residential member and president of Newman College.",
        "Career": "In 1982 he joined law firm Phillips Fox and Masel (now DLA Piper) before heading to the United States to obtain a Master of Business Administration from Columbia Business School.After graduating Columbia, he joined McKinsey & Company and eventually became a senior partner. At McKinsey he worked on the Merrill Lynch account for ten years, and helped develop Merrill's online internet strategy. In 1999, he joined Merrill Lynch in the newly created role of chief marketing officer.  He also joined the 19-member executive management committee.  Within two years, he was in charge of Merrill's brokerage business.Gorman left Merrill in February 2006 to join Morgan Stanley as the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Global Wealth Management Group (GWMG). In October 2007, Gorman took on the additional role of Co-Head of Strategic Planning with Chief Financial Officer Colm Kelleher. In December 2007, he was named Co-President of Morgan Stanley, along with Walid Chammah, with the day-to-day responsibility for Wealth Management and Asset Management.\nIn 2009, he helped create the largest wealth management platform globally when he led the merger and integration of Morgan Stanley's wealth management business with Citi's Smith Barney business. Structured as a staggered acquisition, Morgan Stanley purchased the remainder of the joint venture in June 2013, and is a global leader in wealth management with over 16,000 financial advisors and $1.8 trillion in client assets.In September 2009, it was announced he would become CEO of Morgan Stanley in January 2010. He also assumed the title of Chairman in January 2012 following the retirement of John J. Mack. Press reports indicate his compensation as Chairman and CEO was $9.75 million for 2012, with the New York Times reporting an increase to $18 million in 2013.In 2014 he was included in the 50 Most Influential ranking of Bloomberg Markets Magazine.In the wake of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, which led to a popular vote to leave the European Union, Gorman said there was \"nothing good about Brexit\". He added that some jobs would be moved not only out of England, but out of Europe entirely, possibly to New York City or Tokyo.In January 2020, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) that recognizes Australians who have demonstrated outstanding service or exceptional achievement. Gorman said he was \"honoured to receive this award and extremely proud to represent Australia abroad.\" \"While most of my working life has been in the US my heart remains firmly Australian,\" Mr Gorman said.As a result of his work in 2020, James Gorman was paid a 22% raise ($6 million) from 2019 pay of $27 million by Morgan Stanley, making him the highest-paid bank executive in America. The Wall Street firm generated record revenue that year and announced two multibillion-dollar acquisitions of E*trade Financial Corp. and Eaton Vance Corp. and avoided much of the economic recession caused by the pandemic.Gorman is scheduled to speak at the November 2022 Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, with the Hong Kong Democracy Council claiming that his presence, along with other financial executives, legitimizes the Hong Kong government's whitewashing of the erosion of freedoms in the city. Several members of Congress also warned that US financial executives should not attend the Summit, saying \"Their presence only serves to legitimise the swift dismantling of Hong Kong's autonomy, free press and the rule of law by Hong Kong authorities acting along with the Chinese Communist Party.\"",

    "Stephen Green, Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint": {
        "Introduction": "Stephen Keith Green, Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint (born 7 November 1948), is a British politician, former Conservative Minister of State for Trade and Investment, former group chairman of HSBC Holdings plc, and Anglican priest.",
        "Early life and education": "Stephen Green was born on 7 November 1948 to Dudley Keith Green and Dorothy Rosamund Mary Green (n\u00e9e Wickham). After a private education at Lancing College, near his family home in Brighton,  he attended Exeter College, Oxford, obtaining a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) in 1966. Green's parents were active churchgoers and influenced his religious activities both as a young man and later in life; after graduating he spent a year volunteering in the East End of London at a hostel for recovering alcoholics, a move also reputedly influenced by a visit from a Church of England vicar. It was during his time at the hostel that he met Janian Joy, a fellow volunteer, whom he married in 1971. In 1975 (during a Harkness Fellowship, on secondment from the Overseas Development Administration) Green also obtained a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).",
        "Career": "In 1971, Green began his professional life as a civil servant in the British government's Ministry of Overseas Development (now the Department for International Development), where he spent the next six years. In 1977, he joined McKinsey & Co Inc. management consultants, with whom he undertook assignments in Europe, North America and the Middle East.\nAs a result of being headhunted, Green joined the then Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1982, initially on a two-year contract, with responsibility for corporate planning activities. In 1985 he was put in charge of the development of the bank's global treasury operations, and in 1992 became group treasurer of HSBC Holdings plc with responsibility for the HSBC Group's treasury and capital markets businesses globally.\nIn March 1998 Green was appointed to the Board of HSBC Holdings plc as executive director of Investment Banking and Markets, responsible for the investment banking, private banking and asset management activities of the Group. He assumed additional responsibility for the Group's corporate banking business in May 2002. As executive director, Green cancelled all executive bonuses in both 2001 and 2002, telling The Wall Street Journal in March 2003: \"We took the view that a business that had not performed for the shareholder couldn't expect to receive bonuses\". The decision saw some key staff leave in protest but it also won the company some praise; Institutional Investor  magazine quoted HSBC's then chairman, Sir John Bond, as saying: \"We had corporate clients come up to us and say, 'Thank God you've taken a stand'\".In the year before becoming chief executive, Green earned below \u00a31m; HSBC's annual report for the period showed that none of the company's five top-earning employees was a board member. Green told The Guardian in October 2003: \"Plenty of people in this organisation earn more than me. I genuinely don't care. I can hardly be described as lowly paid. Since when was money the be-all and end-all?\" Asked by the newspaper's reporter Jill Treanor how he reconciled the organization's high salaries and bonuses with his religious faith, he replied: \"Do I personally feel some kind of incompatibility between what I believe and being in financial services markets? I can only say no\".\nHis appointment as group chief executive took effect on 1 June 2003. Shortly afterwards, in October 2003, HSBC announced that it would offshore the work done by its UK finance processing centres in Birmingham, Sheffield, Brentwood and Swansea to India, Malaysia and China within two years. The move, which represented the largest such offshoring in the financial services sector at that time and would lead to the loss of 4,000 British jobs, led the UK trade union UNIFI to warn Green that the \"gloves were off\". He defended the decision, telling The Guardian's Jill Treanor: \"If you are a responsible company like us we do need to think about this on a global basis. We have to approach this in a responsible and human way. I also have to bear in mind that people are going to get jobs in India (and elsewhere). It's wrong to pretend you can protect the existing jobs and wrong to pretend there isn't going to be change. It can't be the right response to say that emerging markets have no right to jobs.\" He added: \"Cost minimisation cannot be the only driver of this. There is no way we want to jeopardise the quality of customer service\". Green also oversaw HSBC's acquisition of Household International, a US subprime lender, as well as its integration into the parent company. He later came to regret the deal, which was the largest acquisition in a series conducted by HSBC in the five years leading up to his appointment as its chief executive.In January 2005, Green became chairman of HSBC Bank plc, the group's UK clearing bank subsidiary, and group executive chairman in June 2006. In its July 2005 issue, Bloomberg Markets magazine reported that HSBC was allowing money laundering by drug dealers and state sponsors of terrorism; the magazine alleged that this had included a transfer of $100,000 in April 2000 to the Taliban in Afghanistan which had subsequently resulted in a fine levied by the US Treasury Department. Green denied the allegations, calling them \"a singular and wholly irresponsible attack on the bank's international compliance procedures\". Subsequent investigations however, confirmed that money laundering had taken place at HSBC for several years throughout Green's tenure as chief executive and chairman, chiefly for the Sinaloa Cartel. Green earned well over \u00a325 million per year at the time. Green's successor as the top of HSBC, Stuart Gulliver, said \"between 2004 and 2010, our anti-money laundering controls should have been stronger and more effective and we failed to spot and deal with unacceptable behaviour.\"",
        "Minister of State for Trade and Investment": "In September 2010, it was announced that Green would join the UK's Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition government in early 2011 as an unpaid Minister of State for Trade and Investment. In order to take up his ministerial position, he stepped down as Group Chairman of HSBC on 3 December 2010 and was replaced by Douglas Flint. To enable him to be accountable to Parliament, he was created a life peer on 16 November 2010 as Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint, of Hurstpierpoint in the County of West Sussex, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 22 November. He was Minister of State for Trade and Investment in both the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 11 January 2011 until 11 December 2013.",
        "Aftermath": "After Green's retirement from HSBC, the questions that had begun to be asked about the bank's behaviour under his leadership continued. On 23 July 2012, the US Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a 335-page report setting out HSBC's compliance failures over a ten-year period. In the report, Senate investigators said the bank had bypassed the USA's sanctions against Iran, enabled money laundering by Mexican drug lords (chiefly for the Sinaloa Cartel), and had conducted business with companies with links to terrorism. The report quoted emails copied to Green detailing such dubious transactions and alleged that the bank had continued to allow them to continue even after he and his colleagues had promised to act. Green told Sky News that he had \"no case to answer\" over the money laundering scandal, saying: \"As and when issues were drawn to our attention, as we were seeking to grapple with the issues, we took action. I think we must acknowledge there were some failures of implementation. HSBC has expressed its regret for that. I share that regret.\"Defending Green, Lord Oakeshott, a former Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \"Stephen Green was a thoughtful banker in holy orders. But if even he couldn't stop these scandals, banks like HSBC and Barclays aren't just too big to fail, they are clearly too big to control\".\nThe Senate report prompted shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, Chris Leslie, to write to Green asking him to \"place on the record \u2013 at the earliest opportunity \u2013 an assurance that you took every appropriate step if and when you became aware of the issues raised by this report\" and asking a number of specific questions. Leslie was unconvinced by Green's reply, in which he had written: \"With regards [sic] to the bank's efforts to address its AML (anti-money laundering) and OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) compliance issues, HSBC has expressed its regret that there were failures of implementation in these areas, and I share that regret\". Leslie maintained that Green's letter failed to: address the detailed questions about what he knew and when about these very serious issues. As a British Minister, an adviser to George Osborne on banking and a member of the Cabinet committee on banking reform, he is accountable first and foremost to Parliament. He cannot and should not hide behind \"continuing discussions between HSBC and the US authorities\" as a reason for failing to answer questions. Shortly afterwards, Green failed to attend the House of Lords to answer a Labour question about the affair. The Leader of the House of Lords, Lord Strathclyde, defended Green, saying that his earlier employment with HSBC did not affect his ability to carry out his duties.In February 2015, there was further criticism of Green and his leadership of HSBC after BBC Television broadcast a Panorama programme entitled The Bank of Tax Cheats exposing the complicity of HSBC's Swiss private bank, HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA, in helping more than 100,000 clients from over 200 countries evade tax worth hundreds of millions of pounds. At the time of the alleged offences Green was the Swiss bank's chairman. BBC presenter Richard Bilton confronted Green, who refused to discuss the issue saying only: \"As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present\". Chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge MP, said: \"Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices. Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer\". A few days after the Panorama broadcast, Green resigned as chairman of the advisory council for banking industry body, The City UK, saying that he did not want to damage the effectiveness of the organisation in promoting good governance and doing the right thing.",

Both companies focus research efforts on the effects of the Internet industrial revolution on businesses, cities, and governments.\nIn 2012, Grillo obtained a PhD in \"Political Economy\" at London School of Economics and Political Science with a thesis on factors that enable growth across different regions in the new millennium. Grillo's thesis contests the conventional hypothesis that greater R&D expenditure necessarily generates a more rapid growth of GDP. While at Oxford Internet Institute and St Antony's College at University of Oxford and at Scuola Superiore Sant\u2019Anna in Pisa, Grillo continued this line of research along with one ranging from pensions to regional development.",
        "Research": "Grillo's research focuses on the so-called \u201cinnovation paradox\", first observed by Robert Solow  in 1987. Observing data available at the time, Solow observed how the rates of growth of GDP had decreased despite the exponential increase of the quantity of information accessible at any given moment. Grillo identifies the cause of the paradox in what he terms the \u201ctechnological obsolescence\u201d of liberal democracies. To illustrate the reasons of the crisis, the economist traces a historical parallel between Internet and the invention of the press by Johannes Gutenberg: both media disintermediated the monopolistic reproduction of information. Since a redistribution of power tends to follow a reallocation of information, 21st Century liberal democracies are in crisis: they no longer possess the tools to govern Internet-triggered societal changes.\nIn comparing Western countries to China, Grillo notes that the Communist country has been more able to govern a technological revolution begun in the West. Meanwhile, Western countries have become more risk-averse, thus widening the gap in terms of societal impact of technologies with China. While similar in some regards to Mariana Mazzucato's work on the Entrepreneurial State, Grillo reflects more on the impact of the Internet on the form of the State itself. Through this comparison with China, Grillo proposes ways to give back to Western democracies the chance to use information to increase the efficiency and efficacy of government.",

    "Rajat Gupta": {
        "Introduction": "Rajat Kumar Gupta (Bengali pronunciation: [\u027e\u0254d\u0292\u0254t kuma\u027e \u0261upt\u0254]; born (1948-12-02)December 2, 1948) is an Indian-American businessman and convicted felon who, as CEO, was the first foreign-born managing director of management consultancy firm McKinsey & Company from 1994 to 2003. In 2012, he was convicted for insider trading and spent two years in prison. Gupta was a board member of corporations including Goldman Sachs, Procter & Gamble and American Airlines, and an advisor to non-profits such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. He is the co-founder of the Indian School of Business, American India Foundation, New Silk Route and Scandent Solutions.\nGupta was convicted in June 2012 on insider trading charges of four criminal felony counts of conspiracy and securities fraud in the Galleon scandal. He was sentenced in October 2012 to two years in prison, an additional year on supervised release and ordered to pay $5 million in fines. His conviction was upheld by a Federal Appeals Court on 25 March 2014. He then lodged an appeal of his conviction with the U.S. Supreme Court which was subsequently upheld in April 2015. An application to remain free until the court determined whether it would hear the appeal was denied in June 2014 leaving Gupta having to commence his two-year prison term that month. He was released on monitored house arrest in January 2016 and from house arrest in March 2016.",
        "Early life and education": "Rajat Gupta was born in Calcutta, India, to a Bengali Baidya father Ashwini Gupta and a Punjabi mother Pran Kumari. His father was a journalist for Ananda Publishers, and a professor in Calcutta's Ripon College prior to that. His mother taught at a Montessori school. Gupta has three siblings.When Gupta was five the family moved to New Delhi, where his father went to start the Delhi-edition of the newspaper Hindustan Standard. Gupta's father died when Gupta was sixteen; Gupta's mother died two years later. Now orphans, Gupta and his siblings \"decided to live by ourselves. It was pretty unusual in those days.\"He was a student at Modern School in New Delhi. After high school, Gupta ranked 15th in the nation in the entrance exam for the Indian Institutes of Technology, IIT JEE. He received a Bachelor of Technology degree in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Delhi in 1971. His economics professor at IIT Delhi was Subramanian Swamy, who wrote his recommendation letter when he applied for Harvard Business School. Declining a job from the prestigious domestic firm ITC Limited, he received an MBA from Harvard Business School (HBS) in 1973. Gupta graduated with distinction as a Baker Scholar. Gupta remarked that the first time he saw an airplane was when he flew to ITC at their request to inform them he would be attending Harvard.",
        "Career": "No information",
        "McKinsey & Company": "Gupta joined McKinsey & Company in 1973 as one of the earliest Indian Americans at the consultancy. He was initially rejected because of inadequate work experience, a decision that was overturned after his Harvard Business School professor Walter J. Salmon called Ron Daniel, then head of the New York office and later also the managing director of McKinsey, wrote on Gupta's behalf.Gupta's mentors at McKinsey included Ron Daniel, the former managing director who as senior partner first hired Gupta into the New York office, and Anupam (Tino) Puri, the first Indian at the firm and eventual senior partner. He, in turn, mentored Anil Kumar as another early Indian-American at the consultancy. Gupta and Kumar \"were the face of McKinsey in India.\" According to The Financial Times, \"the two operated as a forceful double-act to secure business for McKinsey, win access in Washington and build a brotherhood of donors around the Hyderabad-based ISB and a handful of social initiatives.\"Gupta began his career in New York before moving to Scandinavia to become the head of McKinsey offices in 1981. He did well in what was then considered a \"backwater\" area; this is where he first made his mark. Elected senior partner in 1984, he became head of the Chicago office in 1990.\nIn 1994 he was elected the firm's first managing director (chief executive) born outside of the US, and then re-elected twice in 1997 and 2000. Gupta is widely regarded as one of the first Indians to successfully break through the glass ceiling, as the first Indian-born CEO of a multinational corporation (not just a consultancy). During Gupta's time as head of McKinsey, the firm opened offices in 23 new countries and doubled its consultant base to 891 partners, increasing revenue 280 percent to $3.4 billion. His annual salary was estimated at $5\u201310 million USD.However Gupta's tenure was marked by controversy. When Gupta joined McKinsey, it was a small partnership run according to the high standards of its early leader, Marvin Bower, but by the time Gupta became managing director, McKinsey was under pressure from an increasingly competitive market, and Gupta's expansion efforts were said to have watered down McKinsey's vaunted principles. Enron, closely identified with McKinsey, collapsed during his time as managing director. During the dot-com bubble he and Anil Kumar created a program for McKinsey to accept payment from its clients in stock. Gupta's accountability for the shifting of standards was weighed differently by different observers, and some defended him noting that the managing director's job was like trying to \"herd cats\"; Gupta himself described it as \"a sort of servant-leader job,\" with \"at least 150, if not 400, leaders\". In what was seen as a reaction against Gupta's aggressive firm expansion, Gupta's successor Ian Davis was elected by \"emphasizing the need for a return to the McKinsey heritage\".After completing three full terms (the maximum allowed, by a rule he had himself initiated) and nearly a decade as head of the firm, Gupta became senior partner again in 2003 and senior partner emeritus in 2007. According to close friends when he stepped down as McKinsey management director, Gupta lost what NYU's Lechner called \"the halo effect\" including the tremendous status afforded by his previous role. Gupta reportedly began to express a certain resentment about money, as his peers in Silicon Valley and Wall Street (including McKinsey's private equity clients) at the time \"raking in staggering amounts of money while Gupta soldiered on with a mere senior partner's millions\".Gupta maintained an office, executive assistant, email and phone at McKinsey and Company after 2007, and maintains the title \"senior partner emeritus\" of the firm. He also continued to receive a salary from McKinsey as senior partner emeritus, totaling $6 million in 2008 and $2.5 million for each of the following three years. However, in the wake of subsequent scandals a McKinsey spokesperson was quoted as saying, \"Our firm no longer has a professional relationship with Rajat Gupta.\" According to NDTV, \"sources tell us that the firm dropped Mr Gupta from its alumni database, and called clients worldwide to say that they would have nothing to do with him going forward.\" The manner in which the firm severed ties with its former head attracted some controversy. After his release from prison, Gupta continued to be rebuffed by McKinsey.",
        "Outside McKinsey & Company": "In 1997 Gupta co-founded the Indian School of Business (ISB) with friend and fellow senior partner Anil Kumar. The school was ranked number 13 in the world by The Financial Times in its Global MBA Rankings 2011. Gupta and Kumar have both since resigned as chairman and executive board director respectively.Before stepping down as managing director he co-founded Scandent Solutions with Ramesh Vangal and the American India Foundation with Victor Menezes and Lata Krishnan. After McKinsey Gupta co-founded and chaired the private equity firm New Silk Route, formerly named Taj Capital Partners, with Parag Saxena and Victor Menezes.\nIn 2005, five years after Raj Rajaratnam \"gave generously to two of Gupta's favorite Indian causes\", Gupta, Rajaratnam and Ravi Trehan, an investor via BroadStreet Group and another friend of Gupta, co-founded Voyager Capital, 80% owned by Rajaratnam and capitalized at $50 million.\nGupta has served on several high-profile corporate boards as a director during his career. He became a member of the board of Procter & Gamble in 2007, and held that post until March 2011. He was also a member of the board of investment bank Goldman Sachs from 2006 until the expiration of his term in 2010. Gupta was also the non-executive chairman of Genpact from 2007 until March 2011.

In 2011, he became a founding member of the Young India Fellowship. He is the former Co-Chairman of the United Nations Association of America.Gupta's activities in global health include serving as a founding board member and then chairman for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. He served from April 2007 to March 2011. He was the co-founder and founding chairman of the Public Health Foundation of India.

He is a former member of the United Nations Commission on the Private Sector and Development,. In March 2006, he was named the founding chairman for the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI). He remained in that position until resigning in March 2011.In addition, he was the co-founder and co-chairman of the American India Foundation (AIF), the largest diaspora philanthropy organization focused on India and based out of the US. He began the organization in response to an earthquake that struck India in 2001, with its initial goal to help victims. From 2006 to 2011, he served as a trustee for the Rockefeller Foundation.Throughout his career, Gupta has been a part of various global business initiatives. He was previously the chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce, and was appointed as special assistant to the Secretary General for Management Reform for UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2005. From 2008 to 2010, Gupta was a member of the foundation board for the World Economic Forum. Gupta was chairman of the U.S.-India Business Council from 2002 to 2005. He served on Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's global advisory council from its inception until early 2012.",
        "Insider trading conviction and prison service": "On March 1, 2009, the SEC filed an administrative civil complaint against Gupta for insider trading with billionaire and Galleon Group hedge fund founder Rajaratnam. Coverage of the event noted that Anil Kumar \u2014 who, like Gupta, had graduated from IIT, was a highly regarded senior partner at McKinsey, and had also co-founded the Indian School of Business \u2014 had already pleaded guilty to charges in the same case. Gupta, Kumar, and Rajaratnam were all close friends and business partners. Gupta countersued and both sides eventually dropped charges.\nOn October 26, 2010 the United States Attorney's Office filed criminal charges against Gupta. He was arrested in New York City by the FBI and pleaded not guilty. He was released on $10 million bail on the same day. Gupta's lawyer wrote, \"Any allegation that Rajat Gupta engaged in any unlawful conduct is totally baseless .... He did not trade in any securities, did not tip Mr. Rajaratnam so he could trade, and did not share in any profits as part of any quid pro quo.\" The SEC alleged, \"The tips generated 'illicit profits and loss avoidance' of more than $23 million.\" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said, \"Rajat Gupta was entrusted by some of the premier institutions of American business to sit inside their boardrooms, among their executives and directors, and receive their confidential information so that he could give advice and counsel.\"Details of wiretap recordings and trading activity related to the charges were analyzed at length in the media, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the prosecution's and defense's cases.The case focused on the relationship between Raj Rajaratnam, Anil Kumar and Gupta. Gupta, Rajaratnam, and Kumar were all involved to varying degrees as founding partners of private-equity firms Taj Capital and New Silk Route, though Rajaratnam and Kumar left before they began operation. Gupta remained as chairman of New Silk Route, and Rajaratnam eventually invested $50 million in the fund.Rajat Gupta's jury trial began on May 22, 2012. On June 15, 2012, Gupta was found guilty on three counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. He was found not guilty on two other securities fraud charges. At the time, his lawyer told reporters, \"We will be moving to set aside the verdict and will, if necessary, appeal the conviction.\" The maximum sentence for securities fraud is 20 years and the maximum sentence for conspiracy is five years. In arguments in mid-October, prosecutors favored prison time of up to 10 years while defense attorneys favored probation and community service. As one service option, the latter suggested Gupta \"work on health care and agriculture in rural Rwanda\". Prosecutors based their recommendation in part on $11.2 million profits, or losses avoided, by Rajaratnam based on the tips. The defense argued Gupta \"never profited on the alleged trading\" per one news account.On October 24, 2012, Gupta was sentenced to two years in prison by Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the United States District Court in Manhattan for leaking boardroom secrets to former hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. His conviction was upheld by a Federal Appeals Court on March 25, 2014. His prison sentence began on June 17. On June 11, 2014 US Supreme Court rejected Gupta's bail plea, a week before his prison term began.Gupta was released from federal prison on January 5, 2016, on house arrest and required to live at his Manhattan home. He was allowed to go to an office during weekdays starting in January, according to an unnamed source.\nThe house arrest ended in March 2016. Having once rejected the argument, in February 2016 the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed to hear Gupta's appeal to overturn his conviction.\nThe appeal was turned down by the Federal Court on January 7, 2019",
        "After release": "Gupta's memoir, Mind Without Fear, was published by Juggernaut Books in March 2019. In a detailed one hour interview subsequent to publication, he described his side of the story. He said he did not speak during his trial based on the advice of his lawyers.",
        "Personal life": "Rajat Gupta married Anita Mattoo, two years his junior, in 1973 after they had met at IIT Delhi. She was an electrical engineer, and according to him \"a much smarter student\" than himself. The couple met at college debates and plays. Mattoo came from Srinagar, Kashmir, India.\nGupta owns several properties that he uses for both work and pleasure:\n\nHis primary residence in 2011 was a two-acre estate in Westport, Connecticut that formerly belonged to JC Penney and his family, which was valued at $13 million as per town records of October 2011.\nHe owns a $4 million waterfront home on the Gulf of Mexico in Palm Island, Florida to which he transferred his legal residence before going to prison.\nHe owns an apartment in Manhattan.\nHe owns a ranch in Colorado.According to the Economic Times, \"His big mansion in Connecticut is like a public dharamsala, where friends, professors and McKinsey colleagues are encouraged to come and live, often with their families. He is also known to ask colleagues to take a break at his Colorado ranch with their families - something unheard of in the McKinsey world at that time.\"Gupta has four daughters: Geetanjali Gupta-Nwanze, Megha, Aditi and Deepali. On June 21, 2008, Geetanjali Gupta married Chukwuemeka Nwanze, an Igbo from Asaba, Nigeria, son of Vincent Nwanze, former Deputy Consul-General at the Nigerian Consulate in New York. The wedding was held at Rajat Gupta's house in Westport, Connecticut. Geetanjali was reported to be a Harvard BA, MBA and JD as well as a manager of the Harvard endowment fund.Gupta's net worth in 2008 was estimated at US$84 million.",

        "Introduction": "Robert D. Haas (born 1942) is the chairman emeritus of Levi Strauss & Co., son of Walter A. Haas Jr., and the great-great-grandnephew of the company's founder, Levi Strauss.",
        "Biography": "Born and raised in San Francisco, Robert (Bob) Haas received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964, where he was Phi Beta Kappa, and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Harvard Graduate School of Business in 1968, where he was named a Baker Scholar.\nHaas served in the Peace Corps in the Ivory Coast from 1964 to 1966. He was a White House Fellow from 1968 to 1969. After business school, Haas worked as an associate at McKinsey & Company from 1969 to 1972.\nHaas joined Levi Strauss & Co. in 1973 and served in a variety of roles. He was elected to the board of directors in 1979 and as president and chief executive officer in 1984. He served in that position until stepping down in 1999. He became chairman of the board in 1989 and retired from the board in 2014.\nSales and profitability grew during the period of Haas's leadership, thanks largely to the expansion of Levi's branded apparel internationally and the creation and rapid growth of the Dockers brand of casual apparel. Under his leadership, Levi Strauss & Company carried on the company's engagement in corporate social responsibility: it became the first company to define and enforce workplace and safety standards for employees.From his appointment as CEO in 1984, Haas was instrumental in redefining the company's business strategy: He created a flatter organization \u2013 including the reduction of the workforce by one third. He also invested heavily in new product development, marketing and technology.In 1985, Haas returned the company to private ownership. At the time it was announced, the Levi's LBO was the largest in U.S. business history.\nDuring his tenure, Haas built upon the ethical traditions of Levi Strauss & Company. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Robert's grandfather, Walter A. Haas Sr., and great uncle, Daniel E. Koshland Sr., refused to lay off idled employees, risking bankruptcy. Instead they created work projects such as laying wooden floors in the company's factory in San Francisco. Walter Haas Jr. and his brother Peter insisted on running integrated factories in the American South, giving equal treatment to all races during the era of segregation. During his tenure as leader at Levi Strauss,  Haas tried to create a corporate culture in which tens of thousands of employees around the world were treated fairly and well. In addition, the company led the way in addressing a range of social and business issues. In 1982, the company became the first prominent business to become involved in addressing the problems of HIV/AIDS, at the time a largely unknown disease. Under his leadership the company pioneered corporate standards for dealing with HIV-positive employees and created employee AIDS awareness programs. Since the early 1980s the Levi Strauss Foundation has donated over US$60 million to AIDS-oriented non-profits. In 1991 Haas was the first person to be awarded the Edward N. Brandt Jr. Award from the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS for his significant efforts in the fight against HIV and AIDS in the workplace.In 1992, Levi Strauss became the first Fortune 500 company to extend health-care benefits to the unmarried partners of its employees, starting the acceptance of this practice by other leading companies. In that same year the company published the first-ever corporate standards governing the treatment of employees in contractor factories around the world. Since then, these guidelines have been largely adopted by the apparel and footwear industries.",
        "Philanthropy": "Active in support of his alma mater, he endowed the Haas Scholars Program at Berkeley, which funds financial aid eligible, academically talented undergraduates to engage in a sustained research, field-study or creative project in the summer before and during their senior year at Berkeley. Each year, twenty Haas Scholars are selected from all disciplines and departments across the university on the basis of the merit and originality of their project proposals.  He was a member of Berkeley's Board of Visitors, national giving chair for the Campaign for Berkeley, a board member of the Haas School, and, in 2007, the recipient of the Chancellor's Award.  In 2008, Berkeley established the Robert D. Haas Chancellor\u2019s Chair in Equity and Inclusion in his honor.  He serves as a trustee of the Evelyn and Walter Haas Jr. Fund, a San Francisco-based private family foundation established in 1953 with the goal to form a righteous and supportive society that offers basic rights and opportunities to all people. Haas joined the fund's board of directors in 1992 and currently serves as chair of the audit committee. He is a former member of the Trilateral Commission, trustee of the Ford Foundation, member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and honorary trustee of the Brookings Institution, the California Business Roundtable and the Bay Area Council.

        "Introduction": "Torstein Hagen (born 1943) is a Norwegian billionaire businessman, and the founder and chairman of Viking Cruises.",
        "Early life and education": "Hagen was born and raised in Norway. He earned a degree in physics at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, where he completed his master thesis on artificial intelligence and machine learning, won a Fulbright grant to study in the United States, and received an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1968.",
        "Career": "No information",
        "Early years in cruise industry (1974-96)": "Hagen was a consultant, and later partner, for McKinsey & Company in Europe, helping to bring Holland America Line back from near-bankruptcy in 1974. In 1976, he became CEO of Bergen Steamship Company (Bergenske Dampskibsselskab), and then became CEO of Royal Viking Line from 1980 to 1984. After a failed take-over bid, he had to resign in 1984. He joined the board of Holland America Line in 1985, and later served on the board of Kloster Cruise. In the early 1990s, he acquired a 27% stake in Nedlloyd, a Rotterdam-based shipping company, becoming the biggest shareholder. He sold his shares several years later at a loss.",
        "Viking Cruises (1997-present)": "In 1997, Hagen founded Viking River Cruises with the purchase of four river ships, launching the company with four Russian river cruises. Viking serves wealthy American retirees and has more than 70 river cruise ships, which mainly navigate the major European waterways. In May 2013, the company announced plans to start an ocean cruise division, and changed its name to Viking Cruises. Its first ocean cruise was launched in 2015. As of 2016, Hagen has disposed of 23% of Viking Cruises to TPG Capital and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for total of $672 million. As of 2017, the company has a fleet of over 60 vessels, and four ocean going ships. At the beginning of 2020, Hagen announced that Viking would begin offering expedition tours. The first tour would be exploring Antarctica and the Great Lakes of North America in January 2022 with a second tour to begin in August 2022 sailing to Antarctica and the Arctic. The inauguration for the company\u2019s first custom vessel is planned for August 2022.",

    "William Hague": {
        "Introduction": "William Jefferson Hague, Baron Hague of Richmond,  (born 26 March 1961) is a British Conservative Party politician and life peer who served as Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition from 1997 to 2001. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond (Yorks) in North Yorkshire from 1989 to 2015. He served in the Cameron government as First Secretary of State from 2010 to 2015, Foreign Secretary from 2010 to 2014, and Leader of the House of Commons from 2014 to 2015.\nHague was educated at Wath Comprehensive School, the University of Oxford and INSEAD, subsequently being elected to the House of Commons at a by-election in 1989. Hague quickly rose through the ranks of the government of John Major and was appointed to Cabinet in 1995 as Secretary of State for Wales. Following the Conservatives' defeat at the 1997 general election by the Labour Party, he was elected Leader of the Conservative Party at the age of 36.\nHague resigned as Conservative leader after the 2001 general election following his party's second defeat, at which the Conservatives made a net gain of just one seat. He returned to the backbenches, pursuing a career as an author, writing biographies of William Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce. He also held several directorships, and worked as a consultant and public speaker.\nAfter David Cameron was elected Leader of the Conservative Party in 2005, Hague was reappointed to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Foreign Secretary. He also assumed the role of Senior Member of the Shadow Cabinet, serving as Cameron's deputy. Following the formation of the coalition government in 2010, Hague was appointed First Secretary of State and Foreign Secretary. Cameron described him as his \"de facto political deputy\". On 14 July 2014, Hague stood down as Foreign Secretary and became Leader of the House of Commons. He did not stand for re-election at the 2015 general election and was succeeded by Rishi Sunak. He was awarded a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours List on 9 October 2015.",
        "Early life": "Hague was born on 26 March 1961 in Rotherham, Yorkshire, England. He initially boarded at Ripon Grammar School and then attended Wath Comprehensive School, a state secondary school near Rotherham. His parents, Nigel and Stella Hague, ran a soft drinks manufacturing business where he worked during school holidays.He first made the national news at the age of 16 by addressing the Conservatives at their 1977 Annual National Conference. In his speech he told the delegates: \"half of you won't be here in 30 or 40 years' time..., but that others would have to live with consequences of a Labour Government if it stayed in power\". Writing in his diary at the time Kenneth Rose noted that Peter Carrington  told him that \"he and several other frontbench Tories were nauseated by the much-heralded speech of a sixteen-year-old schoolboy called William Hague. Peter said to Norman St John-Stevas: 'If he is as priggish and self-assured as that at sixteen, what will he be like in thirty years' time? Norman replied: 'Like Michael Heseltine'\".Hague read Philosophy, politics and economics at Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with first-class honours. He was President of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), but was \"convicted of electoral malpractice\" in the election process of his successor. OUCA's official historian, David Blair, notes that Hague was actually elected on a platform pledging to clean up OUCA, but that this was \"tarnished by accusations that he misused his position as Returning Officer to help the Magdalen candidate for the presidency, Peter Havey. Hague was playing the classic game of using his powers as President to keep his faction in power, and Havey was duly elected.... There were accusations of blatant ballot box stuffing\".He also served as President of the Oxford Union, an established route into politics. After Oxford, Hague went on to study for a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree at INSEAD. He then worked as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, where Archie Norman was his mentor.",
        "Public life": "No information",
        "Early political career": "Hague contested Wentworth unsuccessfully in 1987, before being elected to Parliament at a by-election in 1989 as Member for the safe Conservative seat of Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he succeeded former Home Secretary Leon Brittan. Following his election he became the then-youngest Conservative MP and despite having only recently become an MP, Hague was invited to join the Government in 1990, serving as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont. After Lamont was sacked in 1993, Hague moved to the Department of Social Security (DSS) where he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. The following year he was promoted as Minister of State in the DSS with responsibility for Social Security and Disabled People. His fast rise up through Government ranks was attributed to his intelligence and debating skills.Hague was appointed a Cabinet Minister in 1995 as Secretary of State for Wales; succeeding John Redwood, who had been castigated for being seen on TV apparently miming the Welsh national anthem at a conference; thus, Hague sought a Welsh Office civil servant, Ffion Jenkins, to teach him the words; they later married. He continued serving in Cabinet until the Conservatives were defeated after 18 years in government, by Labour at the 1997 general election.",
        "Leadership of the Conservative Party": "Following the 1997 general election defeat, Hague was elected Leader of the Conservative Party in succession to John Major, defeating more experienced figures such as Kenneth Clarke and Michael Howard.\nAt the age of 36, Hague was tasked with rebuilding the Conservative Party (fresh from their worst general election result of the 20th century) by attempting to build a more modern image. \u00a3250,000 was spent on the \"Listening to Britain\" campaign to try to put the Conservatives back in touch with the public after losing power; he welcomed ideas about \"compassionate conservatism\" including from the then-Governor of Texas, later President George W. Bush.When he visited a theme park with his Chief of Staff and former local MP, Sebastian (now Lord) Coe, Hague took a ride on a log flume wearing a baseball cap emblazoned 'HAGUE'; Cecil Parkinson described the exercise as \"juvenile\".\nHague steered the Conservatives to a successful result at the European parliamentary elections in June 1999, where the Conservatives gained 36 MEPs ahead of Labour's 29. Hague considered his opposition to the single European currency (the Euro) to be later vindicated by Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown's adoption and subsequent approval of the policy.Hague's authority was challenged by the appointment of Michael Portillo as Shadow Chancellor in 2000. Portillo had been widely tipped to be the next Conservative Party Leader before dramatically losing his seat at the 1997 general election; he was elected as MP for Kensington and Chelsea at a by-election two years later. Soon after Portillo's return to Parliament, Conservative policy on two of Labour's flagship policies was reversed: the minimum wage and independence of the Bank of England. From then and until the 2001 general election Hague's supporters waged an increasingly bitter battle with Portillo's faction; such internecine war significantly contributed to the Conservatives' two subsequent election defeats.\nHague was widely ridiculed for claiming he used to drink \"14 pints of beer a day\" as a teenager. His reputation suffered further damage when a 2001 poll for The Daily Telegraph found that 66% of voters considered him to be \"a bit of a wally\", and 70% of voters believed he would \"say almost anything to win votes\".",
        "\"Foreign Land\" speech": "At a Party Conference speech in March 2001, Hague said:\n\nWe have a Government that has contempt for the views of the people it governs.\nThere is nothing that the British people can talk about that this Labour Government doesn't deride.\nTalk about Europe and they call you extreme. Talk about tax and they call you greedy. Talk about crime and they call you reactionary. Talk about immigration and they call you racist; talk about your nation and they call you Little Englanders.... This Government thinks Britain would be all right if we had a different people. I think Britain would be all right, if only we had a different government.\nA Conservative government that speaks with the voice of the British people.\nA Conservative government never embarrassed or ashamed of the British people.\n\nA Conservative government that trusts the people [....] This country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice. Conservative Governments always have, and always will. But it's precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside.\nFormer Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, a prominent One-nation Conservative, was critical of Hague's Eurosceptic view that Britain was becoming a \"foreign land\", betraying in newspaper interviews that he was uncertain as to whether he could support a Hague-led Conservative Party.",
        "Skill in debate": "Hague's critics assiduously monitored his performance at Prime Minister's Questions each Wednesday in Parliament, having difficulty to find fault. During one particular exchange, while responding to the Queen's Speech of 2000, Hague attacked the Prime Minister's record:\n\nIn more than 20 years in politics, he has betrayed every cause he believed in, contradicted every statement he has made, broken every promise he has given and breached every agreement that he has entered into.... There is a lifetime of U-turns, errors and sell-outs. All those Honourable Members who sit behind the Prime Minister and wonder whether they stand for anything any longer, or whether they defend any point of principle, know who has led them to that sorry state.\nBlair responded by criticising what he saw as Hague's \"bandwagon politics\":\n\n... he started the fuel protest bandwagon, then the floods bandwagon; on defence it became armour-plated, then on air traffic control it became airborne.... Yes, the Right Honourable gentleman made a very witty, funny speech, but it summed up his leadership: good jokes, lousy judgment. I am afraid that in the end, if the Right Honourable gentleman really aspires to stand at this despatch box, he will have to get his policies sorted out and his party sorted out, and offer a vision for the country's future, not a vision that would take us backwards.",
        "Resignation": "On the morning of Labour's second consecutive landslide victory at the 2001 general election, Hague stated: \"we have not been able to persuade a majority, or anything approaching a majority, that we are yet the alternative government that they need.\" At that election the Conservative Party gained just one parliamentary seat more than at the 1997 general election; following this defeat, Hague resigned as party leader.  Hague thus became the second twentieth century Conservative party leader not to become Prime Minister (after Austen Chamberlain) and the first ever to spend his entire tenure in Opposition.",
        "Backbenches": "On the backbenches he occasionally spoke in the House of Commons on issues of the day. Between 1997 and 2002, he was the Chairman of the International Democrat Union. Hague's profile and personal popularity rose thereafter among both Conservative Party members and the wider public following his spell as Party Leader. He has written a biography of 18th-century Prime Minister Pitt the Younger (published in 2004), taught himself how to play the piano, and hosted the 25th anniversary programme for Radio 4 on the political television satire Yes Minister in 2005. In June 2007 he published his second book, a biography of the anti-slave trade campaigner William Wilberforce, shortlisted for the 2008 Orwell Prize for political writing.Hague's annual income was the highest in Parliament, with earnings of about \u00a3400,000 a year from directorships, consultancy, speeches and his parliamentary salary. His income was previously estimated at \u00a31 million annually, but he dropped several commitments and in effect took a salary cut of some \u00a3600,000 on becoming Shadow Foreign Secretary in 2005.Together with former Prime Minister John Major, former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, and Hague's successor Iain Duncan Smith, Hague served for a time on the Conservative Leadership Council, which was set up by Michael Howard upon his election unopposed as Leader of the Conservative Party in 2003.\nAt the 2005 Conservative leadership election he supported the eventual winner David Cameron.\nHe is a member of Conservative Friends of Israel, a group which he joined when he was 15.",
        "Return to the Shadow Cabinet": "Following the 2005 general election, the Conservative Party Leader Michael Howard apparently offered Hague the post of Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, which he turned down citing that his business commitments would make it difficult for him to take on such a high-profile job.On 6 December 2005, David Cameron was elected Leader of the Conservative Party. Hague was offered and accepted the role of Shadow Foreign Secretary and Senior Member of the Shadow cabinet, effectively serving as Cameron's deputy (though not formally, unlike previous Deputy Conservative Leaders Willie Whitelaw, Peter Lilley and Michael Ancram). He had been widely tipped to return to the frontbench under either Cameron or leadership contest runner-up David Davis.\nOn 30 January 2006, by Cameron's instructions, Hague travelled to Brussels for talks to pull Conservative Party MEPs out of the European People's Party\u2013European Democrats Group (EPP-ED) in the European Parliament. (The Daily Telegraph, 30 January 2006). Further, on 15 February 2006, Hague deputed, during David Cameron's paternity leave, at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs). This appearance gave rise to jokes at the expense of Blair, that all three parties that day were being led by 'stand-ins', with the Liberal Democrats represented by Acting Leader Sir Menzies Campbell, the Labour Party by the departing Blair, and the Conservatives by Hague. Hague again deputised for Cameron for several sessions in 2006.",
        "Foreign Secretary": "Prime Minister Cameron's first appointment was Hague as Foreign Secretary. He was also accorded the honorary title of First Secretary of State. In his first overseas visit as British Foreign Secretary, Hague met US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, at WashingtonIn August 2010, Hague set out a values-based foreign policy, stating that: \"We cannot have a foreign policy without a conscience. Foreign policy is domestic policy written large. The values we live by at home do not stop at our shores. Human rights are not the only issue that informs the making of foreign policy, but they are indivisible from it, not least because the consequences of foreign policy failure are human\".Hague further said that: \"There will be no downgrading of human rights under this Government and no resiling from our commitments to aid and development\". He continued saying that \"Indeed I intend to improve and strengthen our human rights work. It is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience, and neither is it in our interests\". However, in March 2011, Hague was criticised by Cardinal Keith O'Brien for increasing financial aid to Pakistan despite persecution of its Christian minority: \"To increase aid to the Pakistan Government when religious freedom is not upheld and those who speak up for religious freedom are gunned down is tantamount to an anti-Christian foreign policy\".In September 2011, Hague told BBC Radio 4's File on 4 investigation Cyber Spies into the legality of domestic cyber surveillance and the export of this technology from the UK to countries with questionable human rights records that the UK had a strong export licence system. The programme also obtained confirmation from the UK's Department for Business Innovation and Skills that cyber surveillance products that break, as opposed to create, encryption do not require export licences.In June 2012, he continued to stand in for David Cameron at PMQs when both the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg were out of the country.\nIn January 2013, Hague visited New Zealand in his capacity as Foreign Secretary, holding talks with New Zealand government ministers, Murray McCully and David Shearer. In March 2013, Hague established the International Leaders Programme, designed to identify and develop partnerships among future global leaders.",
        "Media reaction to FCO appointment": "In early September 2010, newspapers including The Daily Telegraph, The Independent and Daily Mail released stories about allegations surrounding Hague's friendship with 25-year-old Christopher Myers, a history graduate from Durham University, whom he employed as a parliamentary special adviser. A spokesperson stated that \"Any suggestion that the Foreign Secretary's relationship with Chris Myers is anything other than a purely professional one is wholly inaccurate and unfounded.\"On 1 September 2010, Myers resigned from his appointment in light of that press speculation, which prompted Hague to issue a public statement, wherein he confirmed that he had \"occasionally\" shared a hotel room with Myers [for reasons of frugality by upbringing], but refuting the \"utterly false\" suggestions that he had ever been involved in a relationship with any man. A spokesperson for Prime Minister David Cameron reported that he gave his \"full support\" over the media rumours. Figures from both within and without the Conservative Party criticised Hague for his personal response to the stories, with former Conservative leadership candidate, John Redwood, commenting that Hague had shown \"poor judgement\", and the Speaker's wife, Labour-supporting Sally Bercow, speculating that Hague had been given \"duff PR advice\", whilst a parliamentary and ministerial colleague, the Conservative MP, Alan Duncan, described the media coverage as \"contemptible\".",
        "Israel\u2013Palestinian conflict": "Hague was criticised by Israeli leaders after meeting with Palestinians who demonstrated against Israel's barrier in the West Bank. He expressed solidarity with the idea of non-violence and listened to the accounts of left-wing and Palestinian activists. Israeli Opposition Leader Tzipi Livni condemned the statements and said:\n\nThe security barrier has saved lives, and its construction was necessary. The barrier has separated Israel from Palestinian cities and completely changed the reality in Israel, where citizens were exposed to terror every day.",
        "2011 Middle East protests": "In February 2011 security forces in the Bahrain dispersed thousands of anti-government protesters at Pearl Square in the centre of the capital, Manama. Hague informed the House of Commons that he had stressed the need for peaceful action in dealing with the protesters: \"At least three people died in the operation, with hundreds more injured. We are greatly concerned about the deaths that have occurred. I have this morning spoken to the Foreign Minister of Bahrain and HM Ambassador spoke last night to the Bahraini Minister of the Interior. In both cases we stressed the need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters, the importance of respect for the right to peaceful protest and for freedom of expression\".Hague told Sky News that the use of force by the Libyan authorities during the 2011 Libyan Civil War was \"dreadful and horrifying\" and called on the leader to respect people's human rights. A vicious crackdown led by special forces, foreign mercenaries and Muammar Gaddafi loyalists was launched in the country's second city Benghazi, which has been the focus of anti-regime protests. Hague stated to Dermot Murnaghan on Sky: \"I think we have to increase the international pressure and condemnation. The United Kingdom condemns what the Libyan Government has been doing and how they have responded to these protests, and we look to other countries to do the same\".\n\nFollowing delays in extracting British citizens from Libya, a disastrous helicopter attempt to contact the protesters ending with eight British diplomats/SAS arrested and no aircraft carriers or Harriers to enforce a no-fly zone he was accused, by the Labour Opposition, of \"losing his mojo\" in March 2011.In March 2011, Hague said in a speech to business leaders that the examples being set in north Africa and the Middle East will ultimately transform the relationship between governments and their populations in the region. However following the row over whether Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was being targeted by coalition forces, the Foreign Secretary stated that the Libyan people must be free to determine their own future. Hague said: \"It is not for us to choose the government of Libya\u2014that is for the Libyan people themselves. But they have a far greater chance of making that choice now than they did on Saturday, when the opposition forces were on the verge of defeat.\"Hague has warned that autocratic leaders including Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, could be shaken and even toppled by a wave of popular uprisings rippling out from north Africa. said that recent revolts against authoritarian leaders in countries including Libya and Egypt will have a greater historic significance than the 9/11 attacks on the US or the recent financial crisis. He stopped short of threatening military intervention against other dictators, but warned that they will inevitably face \"judgement\" for oppressing their people and suppressing democracy. Repressive African r\u00e9gimes will also face challenges from their populations and from the international community, the Foreign Secretary said: \"Demands for freedom will spread, and that undemocratic governments elsewhere should take heed.\" He added: \"Governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever. They will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease, and will find themselves on the wrong side of history.\"\n\nHague, on his way to Qatar Summit in April 2011, called for intensified sanctions on the Libyan r\u00e9gime and for a clear statement that Gaddafi must go: \"we have sent more ground strike aircraft in order to protect civilians. We do look to other countries to do the same, if necessary, over time\". \"We would like a continued increase in our (NATO's) capability to protect civilians in Libya\", he added. Whether NATO ratcheted up operations depended on what happened on the ground, Hague said. \"These air strikes are a response to movements of, or attacks from, r\u00e9gime forces so what happens will be dependent on that\", he said. Whether the Americans could again be asked to step up their role would also \"depend on the circumstances\", he added.Hague, speaking on the protests in Syria said \"Political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay\". It is thought as many as 60 people have been killed by security forces in the country today (22 April 2011), making it the worst day for deaths since protests against President Bashar al-Assad began over a month ago, reported BBC News.",
        "Syria": "Speaking on the Syrian civil war in August 2011 Hague said of military intervention: \"It's not a remote possibility. Even if we were in favour [of UN-backed military action], which we are not because there's no call from the Arab League for intervention as in the case of Libya, there is no prospect of a legal, morally sanctioned military intervention. Hague added that it was a \"frustrating situation\" and that the \"levers\" at the international community's disposal were severely limited but said countries had to concentrate on other ways of influencing the Assad government. \"We want to see stronger international pressure all round. Of course, to be effective that just can't be pressure from Western nations, that includes from Arab nations... and it includes from Turkey who has been very active in trying to persuade President Assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling actions\", he said. \"I would also like to see a United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn this violence, to call for the release of political prisoners, to call for legitimate grievances to be responded to\", he added.During 2012 the UK started training Syrian opposition activists in Istanbul on media, civil society and local government matters, and supplying non-lethal equipment such as satellite communications and computers.On 24 February 2012, Hague recognised the Syrian National Council as a \"legitimate representative\" of the country. Hague also said Bashar al-Assad's government had \"forfeited the right to lead\" by \"miring itself in the blood of innocent people\". Hague said: \"Today we must show that we will not abandon the Syrian people in their darkest hour\". He added that \"Those responsible for the murder of entire families, the shelling of homes, the execution of detainees, the cleansing of political opponents and the torture and rape of women and children must be held to account\", he said.In March 2012, Hague ordered the evacuation of all British diplomats from Syria and closed the UK embassy in Damascus because of mounting security threats. Hague told Parliament: \"We have maintained an embassy in Damascus despite the violence to help us communicate with all parties in Syria and to provide insight into the situation on the ground\". He added: \"We now judge that the deterioration of the security situation in Damascus puts our embassy staff and premises at risk.\" Hague said that his decision \"in no way reduces the UK's commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on the Assad r\u00e9gime to end the violence\". He went on to say that: \"We will continue to work closely with other nations to co-ordinate diplomatic and economic pressure on the Syrian r\u00e9gime.\"\n\nOn 1 April 2012, Hague met 74 other nations at a Friends of Syria Group conference in Istanbul, Turkey. Hague said the issue could return to the United Nations Security Council if current efforts to resolve the crisis fail. The government of President Assad has said it accepts a peace plan by the UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, but there has been little evidence that it is prepared to end its crackdown on the opposition. Hague accused Assad of \"stalling for time\" and warned that if the issue does return to the Security Council, he may no longer be able to rely on the backing of Russia and China, who blocked a previous resolution calling for him to stand down. \"There isn't an unlimited period of time for this, for the Kofi Annan process to work before many of the nations here want us to go back to the UN Security Council\u2014some of them will call for arming the opposition if there isn't progress made,\" Hague told the BBC. He added that \"What is now being put to them is a plan from Kofi Annan supported by the whole United Nations Security Council, and this is an important point, it's supported by Russia and by China as well as by the more obvious countries\u2014the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Arab League and so on\".On 20 November 2012, Hague recognised the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the \"sole legitimate representative\" of the Syrian people, and a credible alternative to the current Syrian Government.On 29 August 2013, the British Parliament refused to ratify the British Government's plan to participate in military strikes against the Syrian Government in the wake of a chemical-weapons attack at Ghouta. Hague denied suggestions that he had threatened to resign over Prime Minister David Cameron's decision to go straight to a parliamentary vote. After the vote, Hague continued to urge other governments to take action against the Syrian Government, saying \"If it is decided in the various parliaments of the world that no-one will stand up to the use of chemical weapons and take any action about that, that would be a very alarming moment in the affairs of the world\". Ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons.",
        "Proposal of elected EU presidency": "In June 2011, Hague dismissed Tony Blair's vision for an elected-head of the European Union by insisting that member states have more pressing priorities than further \"constitutional tinkering\". Hague made clear his view after Blair argued that a directly elected President of Europe, representing almost 400m people from 27 countries, would give the EU clear leadership and enormous authority. In an interview with The Times, Blair set out the agenda that he thought a directly elected EU President should pursue, although he conceded, there was \"no chance\" of such a post being created \"at the present time\". Asked about the former Prime Minister's call for further European integration and the creation of an elected-President, Hague suggested that Blair may have been thinking of the role for himself. \"I can't think who he had in mind\", Hague joked, further adding on a serious note: \"Elected presidents are for countries. The EU is not a country and it's not going to become a country, in my view, now or ever in the future. It is a group of countries working together\".",
        "Taliban talks": "In June 2011, Hague said that Britain helped initiate \"distasteful\" peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Hague made the comments while on a three-day tour of the country to meet President Hamid Karzai and visited British troops. He told The Sun newspaper that Britain had led the way in persuading US President Barack Obama's administration that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict. Hague admitted that any deal might mean accepting \"distasteful things\" and could anger military veterans and relatives of the 374 British troops killed in Afghanistan. However, he said he believed that Britain as a whole was \"realistic and practical\" enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security. He told the newspaper: \"An eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security.\" He added, \"but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful. In all these types of situations, you do have to face up to some distasteful things.\" The previous night US President Barack Obama told Americans that \"the tide of war is receding\" as he announced plans to withdraw 33,000 US troops from Afghanistan by September 2012.",
        "Comments on the Euro": "In September 2011, Hague said that the Euro is \"a burning building with no exits\" for some of the countries which adopted the currency. Hague first used the expression when he was Conservative Leader in 1998\u2014and said in an interview with The Spectator he had been proved right: \"It was folly to create this system. It will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly. But it's there and we have to deal with it,\" he said. \"I described the Euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it,\" he further said, adding \"I might take the analogy too far but the Euro wasn't built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it\".",
        "Iran": "In February 2012, Hague warned in a BBC interview about Iran's \"increasing willingness to contemplate\" terrorism around the world. He cited the 2011 Iran assassination plot, an attempt to assassinate Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, as well as alleged involvement in recent attacks in New Delhi, Georgia, and Bangkok. He said it showed \"the danger Iran is currently presenting to the peace of the world\".Hague spoke the Commons on 20 February about the nuclear program of Iran and said that if the Tehran r\u00e9gime managed to construct a viable weapon, its neighbours would be forced to build their own nuclear warheads too. He accused Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of pursuing \"confrontational policies\" and described the country's enrichment of uranium in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions as \"a crisis coming steadily down the track\". \"Our policy is that whilst we remain unswervingly committed to diplomacy, it is important to emphasise to Iran that all options are on the table\", Hague told MPs.In March he condemned the way parliamentary elections were staged, claiming they were not \"free and fair\". He said the poll had been held against a backdrop of fear that meant the result would not reflect the will of the people. Hague said: \"It has been clear for some time that these elections would not be free and fair. \"The r\u00e9gime has presented the vote as a test of loyalty, rather than an opportunity for people freely to choose their own representatives. The climate of fear, created by the r\u00e9gime's crushing of opposition voices since 2009, persists.\"",
        "Falkland Islands": "The 30th anniversary of the beginning of the 1982 Falklands War was on 2 April 2012. On 29 March, before the Lord Mayor of London's banquet guests, namely the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than 100 ambassadors, including Alicia Castro (Argentinian Ambassador), Hague said the UK was keen to deepen its relationship with Latin America\u2014and reiterated Britain's commitment to the Falklands. He said: \"We are reversing Britain's decline in Latin America, where we are opening a new Embassy in El Salvador. This determination to deepen our relations with Latin America is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of self-determination of the people of the Falkland Islands\".\nTensions over the Falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary. In February, Hague said deployments of a British warship, HMS Dauntless and the Duke of Cambridge to the Falklands were \"entirely routine\". Hague said that Britain affirmed the Falklanders' self-determination and would seek to prevent Argentina from \"raising the diplomatic temperature\" over the issue. He further said: \"(the events) are not so much celebrations as commemorations. I think Argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict. Since both countries will be doing that I don't think there is anything provocative about that.\"",
        "Turks and Caicos Islands": "Hague set out Her Majesty's Government's plans, on 12 June 2012, for the reintroduction of self-government in the Turks and Caicos Islands, where direct rule of the Governor had been in place since the islands had been subject to corruption and maladministration under the previous autonomous administration.",
        "Julian Assange and right of asylum": "In August 2012, Hague declared that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks organisation founder, would not be granted political asylum by the United Kingdom. Hague declared the UK's willingness to extradite Assange to the Swedish authorities who had requested his extradition; thus Swedish prosecutors, unwilling to break diplomatic protocol, have deferred from interrogating Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador, London.Hague confirmed the British Government's position \u2013 that it is lawfully obliged to extradite Julian Assange. \"We're disappointed by the statement by Ecuador's Foreign Minister today that Ecuador has offered political asylum to Julian Assange. Under our Laws, with Mr. Assange having exhausted all options of appeal, the British authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to Sweden. We must carry out that obligation and of course we fully intend to do so,\" Hague confirmed.\nFollowing The Guardian newspaper outcry over a Foreign Office note sanctioned by Hague sent to the Ecuadorian Embassy\u2014in which it raised the possibility of the revocation of their diplomatic status under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987\u2014the Foreign Secretary reaffirmed the UK remained \"committed to a diplomatic solution\" and played down any suggestion of a police raid of the Ecuadorian Embassy, stating \"there is no threat here to storm an embassy\".The former ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, warned that using the 1987 Act to raid the Ecuadorian Embassy would be in \"breach of the Vienna Convention of 1961\". Russia warned Britain against violating fundamental diplomatic principles (Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and in particular the Article 22 spelling out the inviolability of diplomatic premises), which the Government of Ecuador invoked.Hague is the subject of a portrait in oil commissioned by Parliament.",
        "Leader of the House of Commons and retirement": "Once Hague had formally declared his intention not to seek re-election as MP for Richmond at the forthcoming 2015 general election, he told David Cameron he would be standing down as Foreign Secretary. Cameron instigated a Cabinet reshuffle whereby Hague became Leader of the House of Commons. Hague remained as Cameron's \"de facto political deputy\", retained his membership of the National Security Council and played a lead role in reaching out to voters in the North of England in the run up to the general election.In a surprise motion on his last day in the House of Commons, Hague moved to make the election for Speaker in the next parliament a secret ballot, in what was seen as an effort to oust the incumbent John Bercow for lacking the neutrality expected of a Speaker of the House. Charles Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne, Chairman of the Procedure Committee and responsible for Speaker elections, stated that he had written a report about such an idea \"years ago\" and despite speaking with Hague and Michael Gove earlier that week, neither had told him of any such move. A visibly emotional Walker told the House, \"I have been played as a fool. When I go home tonight, I will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me. I would much rather be an honourable fool, in this and any other matter, than a clever man.\" Walker received a standing ovation, mainly from the Labour benches, whilst the Government lost its parliamentary motion by 228 to 202 votes. During the debate the future Father of the House, Gerald Kaufman, denounced Hague, saying: \"Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that this grubby decision is what he personally will be remembered for? After a distinguished career in the House of Commons, both as a leader of a party and as a senior Cabinet Minister, he has now descended to squalor in the final days of the Parliament.\"He was succeeded as MP for Richmond (Yorks) by future Chancellor of the Exchequer and future Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
        "In retirement": "On 9 October 2015, Hague was created Baron Hague of Richmond, of Richmond in the County of North Yorkshire.In August 2020, Hague endorsed Joe Biden for U.S. president over incumbent Donald Trump, arguing that a Biden victory was in the UK's interest.",
        "Illegal wildlife trade fighter": "Hague and the then Duke of Cambridge identified, while the former was in post as Foreign Secretary, that the illegal wildlife trade (IWT) was among the most profitable criminal enterprises in the world, and in order to combat it formed in 2014 the Transport Task Force (TTF). The TTF seeks to identify and stop wildlife trafficking. They continue to work at this in 2020. The Financial Task Force was created in 2018 to help further the goal.",
        "Royal Foundation": "In September 2020, Hague was appointed as chairman of the Royal Foundation, a charitable organisation operating under the auspices of the then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in succession to Sir Keith Mills who retired.",

        "On coronavirus": "Hague has been particularly sharp on the COVID\u201319 pandemic, writing as early as 10 February 2020 that \"Coronavirus is a calamity for China. It cannot continue its dangerous wildlife practices any longer.\" Hague wrote on 2 March that: \"The rise of coronavirus is a clear indication that the degrading of nature will come back to hit humans very hard.\" Hague returned to the subject on 13 April, when he said that the \"world must act now on wildlife markets or run the risk of worse pandemics in future\".",

    "Mohsin Hamid": {
        "Introduction": "Mohsin Hamid (Urdu: \u0645\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u062d\u0627\u0645\u062f; born 23 July 1971) is a British Pakistani novelist, writer and brand consultant. His novels are Moth Smoke (2000), The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2007), How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia (2013), Exit West (2017), and The Last White Man (2022).",
        "Early life and education": "Born to family of Punjabi and Kashmiri descent, Hamid spent part of his childhood in the United States, where he stayed from the age of 3 to 9 while his father, a university professor, was enrolled in a PhD program at Stanford University. He then moved with his family back to Lahore, Pakistan, and attended the Lahore American School.At the age of 18, Hamid returned to the United States to continue his education. He graduated summa cum laude with an A.B. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1993 after completing an 127-page-long senior thesis, titled \"Sustainable Power: Integrated Resource Planning in Pakistan\", under the supervision of Robert H. Williams. While he was a student at Princeton, Hamid studied under Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison. Hamid wrote the first draft of his first novel for a fiction workshop taught by Morrison. He returned to Pakistan after college to continue working on it.Hamid then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1997. Finding corporate law boring, he repaid his student loans by working for several years as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company in New York City. He was allowed to take three months off each year to write, and he used this time to complete his first novel Moth Smoke.",
        "Work": "Hamid moved to London in the summer of 2001, initially intending to stay only one year. Although he frequently returned to Pakistan to write, he continued to live in London for eight years, becoming a dual citizen of the United Kingdom in 2006. In 2004 he joined the brand consultancy Wolff Olins, working only three days a week so as to retain time to write. He later served as managing director of Wolff Olins' London office, and in 2015 was appointed the firm's first-ever Chief Storytelling Officer.Hamid's first novel, Moth Smoke, told the story of a marijuana-smoking ex-banker in post-nuclear-test Lahore who falls in love with his best friend's wife and becomes a heroin addict. It was published in 2000, and quickly became a cult hit in Pakistan and India. It was also a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award given to the best first novel in the US, and was adapted for television in Pakistan and as an operetta in Italy.\nMoth Smoke had an innovative structure, using multiple voices, second person trial scenes, and essays on such topics as the role of air-conditioning in the lives of its main characters. Pioneering a hip, contemporary approach to English language South Asian fiction, it was considered by some critics to be \"the most interesting novel that came out of [its] generation of subcontinent (English) writing.\" In the New York Review of Books, Anita Desai noted:One could not really continue to write, or read about, the slow seasonal changes, the rural backwaters, gossipy courtyards, and traditional families in a world taken over by gun-running, drug-trafficking, large-scale industrialism, commercial entrepreneurship, tourism, new money, nightclubs, boutiques... Where was the Huxley, the Orwell, the Scott Fitzgerald, or even the Tom Wolfe, Jay McInerney, or Brett Easton Ellis to record this new world? Mohsin Hamid's novel Moth Smoke, set in Lahore, is one of the first pictures we have of that world.\nHis second novel, The Reluctant Fundamentalist, told the story of a Pakistani man who decides to leave his high-flying life in America after a failed love affair and the terrorist attacks of 9/11. It was published in 2007 and became a million-copy international best seller, reaching No.4 on the New York Times Best Seller list. The novel was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, won several awards including the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award and the Asian American Literary Award, and was translated into over 25 languages. The Guardian selected it as one of the books that defined the decade.\nLike Moth Smoke, The Reluctant Fundamentalist was formally experimental. The novel used the unusual device of a dramatic monologue in which the Pakistani protagonist continually addresses an American listener who is never heard from directly. (Hamid has said The Fall by Albert Camus served as his model.) According to one commentator, because of this technique:maybe we the readers are the ones who jump to conclusions; maybe the book is intended as a Rorschach to reflect back our unconscious assumptions. In our not knowing lies the novel's suspense... Hamid literally leaves us at the end in a kind of alley, the story suddenly suspended; it's even possible that some act of violence might occur. But more likely, we are left holding the bag of conflicting worldviews. We're left to ponder the symbolism of Changez having been caught up in the game of symbolism\u2014a game we ourselves have been known to play.\nIn an interview in May 2007, Hamid said of the brevity of The Reluctant Fundamentalist: \"I'd rather people read my book twice than only half-way through.\"His third novel, How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, was excerpted by The New Yorker in their 24 September 2012 issue and by Granta in their Spring 2013 issue, and was released in March 2013 by Riverhead Books. As with his previous books, How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia bends conventions of both genre and form. Narrated in the second person, it tells the story of the protagonist's (\"your\") journey from impoverished rural boy to tycoon in an unnamed contemporary city in \"rising Asia,\" and of his pursuit of the nameless \"pretty girl\" whose path continually crosses but never quite converges with his. Stealing its shape from the self-help books devoured by ambitious youths all over \"rising Asia,\" the novel is playful but also quite profound in its portrayal of the thirst for ambition and love in a time of shattering economic and social upheaval. In her New York Times review of the novel, Michiko Kakutani called it \"deeply moving,\" writing that How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia \"reaffirms [Hamid's] place as one of his generation's most inventive and gifted writers.\"Hamid has also written on politics, art, literature, travel, and other topics, most recently on Pakistan's internal division and extremism in an op-ed for the New York Times. His journalism, essays, and stories have appeared in TIME, The Guardian, Dawn, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The International Herald Tribune, the Paris Review, and other publications. In 2013 he was named one of the world's 100 Leading Global Thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine.\nHamid's fourth novel, Exit West (2017), is about a young couple, Nadia and Saeed, and their relationship in a time where the world is taken by storm by migrants. It was shortlisted for the 2017 Booker prize.\nHis novels have also been criticised for providing a limited, often one-dimensional representation of Muslim existence, invoking religious symbols/beliefs only to associate them with possibly fundamentalist or terror-sympathising leanings.",
        "Personal life": "Hamid moved to Lahore in 2009 with his wife Zahra and their daughter Dina (born on 14 August 2009). He now divides his time between Pakistan and abroad, living between Lahore, New York, and London. Hamid has described himself as a \"mongrel\" and has said of his own writing that \"a novel can often be a divided man\u2019s conversation with himself.\" He is a dual British and Pakistani citizen.",

    "Dido Harding": {
        "Introduction": "Diana Mary \"Dido\" Harding, Baroness Harding of Winscombe (born 9 November 1967), is a British businesswoman and Conservative life peer. She served as chairwoman of NHS Improvement from 2017, and from May 2020 to April 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she was the head of the NHS Test and Trace programme.\nShe is a former chief executive of the TalkTalk Group where she faced calls for her to resign after a cyber attack revealed the details of up to four million customers; the company was subsequently fined \u00a3400,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office for its negligence. A member of the Conservative Party, Harding is married to Conservative Party Member of Parliament John Penrose and is a friend of former Prime Minister David Cameron. Harding was appointed as a Member of the House of Lords by Cameron in 2014. She holds a board position at the Jockey Club, which is responsible for several major horse-racing events including the Cheltenham Festival.\nIn May 2020, Harding was appointed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock to head NHS Test and Trace, established to track and help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in England. In August 2020, after it was announced Public Health England was to be abolished, Harding was also appointed interim chief executive of the new National Institute for Health Protection, later renamed the UK Health Security Agency. Both these roles ended on the formal establishment of the new agency on 1 April 2021. In June 2021, Harding temporarily stood aside as NHS Improvement Chair to apply, unsuccessfully, for the position of Chief Executive of NHS England.",
        "Early life": "Harding is the daughter of John Harding, 2nd Baron Harding of Petherton, and the granddaughter of Field Marshal John Harding, 1st Baron Harding of Petherton, who commanded the Desert Rats for a few months in World War II.Raised on the family pig farm in Dorset, she was educated from 1978 to 1985 at St Antony's Leweston, then an all-girl private Catholic school. She then graduated in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, from Magdalen College, Oxford, where she studied under Vernon Bogdanor and alongside David Cameron, and then studied at Harvard Business School, gaining an MBA.",
        "Career": "Upon graduating in 1988 she joined the management consultancy McKinsey & Company. In 1995 she was appointed marketing director of Thomas Cook before moving to Manpower and Kingfisher in 1998 and Woolworths in 1999. From 2000 to 2004 she was \u201ccommercial director for value added foods\" and then \u201cinternational support director\u201d at Tesco. In 2007 she moved to Sainsbury's as convenience store director, and took a seat on the operating board in 2008.\nShe was named the first CEO of TalkTalk in 2010, when Carphone Warehouse split its telecoms business from its retail operation. She was appointed as a non-executive director on The Court of The Bank of England in July 2014. She has also served on the boards of British Land and Cheltenham Racecourse.In October 2015, TalkTalk experienced a cyber-attack, during which personal and banking details of up to four million customers, not all of which were encrypted, were thought to have been accessed. City A.M. described her responses as \"naive\", noting that early on, when asked if the affected customer data was encrypted or not, she replied: \"The awful truth is that I don't know\". Her inflexible line on termination fees was also criticised. Marketing ran a headline, \"TalkTalk boss Dido Harding's utter ignorance is a lesson to us all\". The Evening Standard noted that \"It has been a tough week for TalkTalk boss Dido Harding, facing complaints from customers and calls for her head\". The company admitted the incident had cost it \u00a360 million and lost it 95,000 customers. Fining the company \u00a3400,000, the Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham blamed a \"failure to implement the most basic cyber security measures.\"In February 2017, Harding announced that she would stand down as CEO of TalkTalk in order to focus more on her public service activities. In January 2018 she joined the main board of the Jockey Club, which runs many of British horse racing's most popular events, including the Grand National, the Cheltenham Festival and the Derby.",
        "Political service": "Harding joined the House of Lords as a Conservative life peer on 20 October 2014. She has sat on the Economic Affairs Committee since 27 June 2017. She has not rebelled against her party on any of the votes she has attended during her time in the House.",
        "Public service": "In October 2017, Harding was appointed chair of NHS Improvement, which is responsible for overseeing all NHS hospitals, comprising foundation trusts and NHS trusts, as well as independent providers of NHS-funded care. Parliament's Health Select Committee, at that time chaired by former Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, recommended that Harding resign as a Conservative peer and sit as a crossbench peer in order to \"allow for greater parliamentary and public confidence in her ability to challenge government ministers and policies if this role demands it\". Harding did not accept this. Her role ceased in July 2022, when NHS Improvement was merged into NHS England.In May 2020, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that Harding was to be put in charge of the \"track, test and trace\" programme (later given the name NHS Test and Trace) as part of the UK government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, a case was lodged jointly by the not-for-profit Good Law Project and the Runnymede Trust, a race equality think tank, to challenge the legality of this appointment. In February 2022, two High Court judges ruled that Hancock had failed to comply with the Equality Act 2010 when appointing Harding, and also when appointing Mike Coupe as director of testing in September 2020. The court was told that Harding intervened to add Coupe, a former colleague of hers at Sainsbury's, to the shortlist of candidates.On 18 June 2020 it was announced by Hancock that the UK government intended to switch its contact-recording mobile phone app from a centralised model to the decentralised approach pioneered by Apple and Google, due to privacy concerns, among other things. Harding was to decide on the suitability of the alternative model. She stated that \"what we've done in really rigorously testing both our own COVID-19 app and the Google-Apple version is demonstrate that none of them are working sufficiently well to be actually reliable to determine whether any of us should self-isolate for two weeks [and] that's true across the world\". The change was, however, widely interpreted in the press as an abandonment of the UK's app in favour of the Apple-Google one, and a U-turn by the government. The BBC also reported that the \"latest developments come a day after the BBC revealed that a former Apple executive, Simon Thompson, was taking charge of the late-running project as part of Baroness Harding's team\".In August 2020 the government announced a merger between Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace to form the National Institute for Health Protection, with Harding as interim chief executive. The appointment was criticised by health experts as she did not have a background in health, and because of her political position. The Guardian quoted allies of hers who, in response, said that she had quickly learned after being appointed chair of NHS Improvement in 2017 and that she had a record of \"getting things done\" while working in business. It has been widely claimed that her appointments to various public bodies came about through nepotism and her alliances with members of the Conservative party and key figures in the political establishment. Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law Project, wrote: \"For ministers or special advisers to choose their friends or close associates for these key roles is to exclude those who are more able, or better value. And ultimately it is the public interest that suffers.\" In 2022 the Runnymede Trust won a High Court action that Matt Hancock had failed to comply with public sector equality duty when appointing Harding to head the National Institute for Health Protection.As the second spike of the pandemic developed into the winter of 2020 and over Christmas, commentary developed in much of the press about Harding's absence from the national stage as hospitalisations and deaths grew alarmingly. The columnist Rod Liddle in the right-leaning The Sunday Times complained: \"Test and Trace has cost the taxpayer \u00a322bn. It has repeatedly failed to achieve targets it has been set. It was once heralded as The Thing That Would Defeat Covid, but nobody talks about it much any more.\"In January 2021, Harding defended spending upwards of \u00a31,000-a-day each on consultants for the contact tracing programme. Appearing before the Public Accounts Committee, Harding told MPs she felt it was \"appropriate\" to bring in external help in \"extreme emergency circumstances\".In June 2021, Harding took a temporary leave of absence from her role as chair of NHS Improvement to apply unsuccessfully for the position of Chief Executive of NHS England, with Sir Andrew Valentine Morris acting in the interim.",

Penrose sits on the advisory board of a think tank called 1828, which calls for the NHS to be replaced by an insurance system and for Public Health England to be scrapped.Harding is a horse racing enthusiast and member of the Jockey Club, joining the main board in January 2018. In 1993 she borrowed \u00a37,000 from her bank to buy an Irish thoroughbred to ride in ladies' point-to-point races. In 1998, her horse Cool Dawn won the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Harding rode Cool Dawn herself for three seasons, achieving second place in the 1996 Foxhunter Chase at Cheltenham. She said that the horse: \"... taught me that dreams come true, sometimes, that actually miracles can happen. Isn't that a great gift? I think it shaped my business career ...\".",

This reduced staff numbers from 280 to 160, prompting conflict with the Australian Manufacturing Worker's Union. Strikes led to The Age losing an edition for the first time in its history, and Hilmer delayed the opening of the new facility for three months to force the union to concede to the demand of management to have sole discretion over which staff were transferred to the new facility. At the conclusion of the dispute, Hilmer issued each member of the management group who presided over the building of the Tullamarine plant with a golf ball inscribed with the names of unionists who he considered had given them trouble.

He has also been Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) since 2020. Hoekstra previously served as Minister of Finance in the third Rutte cabinet from 2017 to 2022.",
        "Early life": "Hoekstra was born in Bennekom, Gelderland, and studied law at Leiden University from 1994 and obtained his LLM degree in 2001. He also studied history at this university for one year, in which he received a propaedeutic diploma in 1997. During his student days in Leiden he was president of the fraternity Minerva.

Until 2006 he worked for Shell in Berlin, Hamburg and Rotterdam.",
        "Political career": "No information",
        "Early beginnings": "Hoekstra was the treasurer of the CDA-affiliated foundation Eduardo Freistichting and board member of the local CDA association in Amsterdam. Ahead of the 2010 elections, Hoekstra was offered a spot on the party's candidate list for the House of Representatives, but he did not accept it, preferring to continue working at McKinsey.In December 2010, it was announced that Hoekstra was a candidate for the Senate election of 2011, for which he was indeed elected, and sworn in on 7 June 2011 as its youngest member. Membership of the Senate is a part-time position, and therefore Hoekstra continued as consultant with McKinsey. On 6 December of the same year, he gave his maiden speech during the debate on a tax-related topic. In the Senate, he stood out as the party's spokesperson for pensions. He was not reluctant to deviate from the party line on a number of ethical issues: he was the only CDA senator to vote in favour of a ban on civil servants refusing to marry same-sex couples (weigerambtenaar) and to vote in favour of legal status for lesbian parents (meemoederschap). He was reelected in 2015. Ahead of the 2017 general election, Hoekstra helped writing the CDA's manifesto.Hoekstra was nominated by the parliamentary press in 2013 as 'political talent of the year' and in 2016 he was the second-youngest person in the De Volkskrant top-200 of influential Dutch people. In 2016, he was one of the lead architects of the party platform.",
        "Minister of Finance, 2017\u20132022": "Hoekstra was appointed Minister of Finance in the third Rutte cabinet on 26 October 2017, succeeding Jeroen Dijsselbloem.At his first meeting with other EU Ministers of Finance in Brussels in 2017, Hoekstra expressed scepticism about eurozone reform, saying that budgetary discipline in other eurozone states was necessary first. Hoekstra reiterated his reluctance on eurozone reform at a meeting of the financial council of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in 2018, warning against reforms initiated by Germany and France without the support of other member states or the public. Furthermore, at a visit to his German counterpart Olaf Scholz in March 2018, Hoekstra explained that he is reluctant about plans for an eurozone budget, an eurozone finance minister and a common deposit insurance scheme. After Germany and France had outlined a series of eurozone reforms in June 2018, Hoekstra led a coalition of twelve other member states in opposition to such reforms, which would later be referred to as the New Hanseatic League. In January 2019, Hoekstra criticised the European Commission for its decision not to launch a disciplinary procedure against Italy over its deficit and debt, stating \"It\u2019s a missed opportunity to do the right thing for the long run\", a concern later repeated by Prime Minister Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum.During his time in office, Hoekstra oversaw the government's purchase of a stake in Air France KLM equal to that of the French government to increase its influence in the carrier's business operations in 2019. That same year, led negotiations with the German government on the possibility of buying a stake in grid operator TenneT.Since 2018, Hoekstra has been chairing a newly established, informal grouping of small northern and Baltic EU member states \u2013 Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania and the Netherlands \u2013  to find common cause on the direction of eurozone reforms. Hoekstra has also expressed his opposition to an increase in the Netherlands' contribution to the EU budget as a result of Brexit. In 2019, Hoekstra joined forces with his counterparts of Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Latvia in pushing for the establishment of new EU supervisory authority that would take over from states the oversight of money laundering at financial firms.In March 2020, after a tense meeting with fellow EU national leaders where Hoekstra called for an investigation into southern European countries\u2019 proclaimed lack of budgetary capacity to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, Portuguese Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa referred to his comments as \"repugnant\", saying that \"this recurrent pettiness completely undermines what the spirit of the European Union is.\"On 31 October 2020, Hoekstra stated that the Dutch government would not provide further financial assistance to KLM as long as it did not agree with financial sacrifices by all employees for a period of five years. In discussions with KLM, the Dutch Airline Pilots Association (Dutch: Vereniging van Nederlandse Verkeersvliegers) and the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions refused to comply with the five-year period Hoekstra requested. Several days later the parties agreed with the terms and the Dutch cabinet approved the deal with KLM on 4 November.On 11 December 2020, a day after Hugo de Jonge announced his resignation as Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal, the party's board unanimously nominated Hoekstra to succeed him.On 15 January 2021, Hoekstra stepped down along with the Dutch government, after thousands of families were wrongly accused of child welfare fraud. In April 2021, he joined forces with Sigrid Kaag in putting forward a motion of censure to voice their disapproval of Prime Minister Rutte.On 2009, leaked documents show that Hoekstra obtained shares in an offshore company, Candace Management Ltd., based in the British Virgin Islands. He acquired more shares in 2013 and 2014, while he was a senator.On 5 October 2021, Paul Tang, a Dutch centre-left MEP who chairs the European Parliament's tax committee, argued that Hoekstra should symbolically stay out of the EU tax-haven decision. \"Hoekstra, who had investments in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), should excuse himself from this decision,\" Tang added.",

She went to work for Oracle Corporation, first as a software developer, then as a software development manager. In 1992, she left Oracle to earn an MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1994, then used it as a management consultant for consulting firm McKinsey & Company until 2003.",
        "Microsoft": "Microsoft was one of Hogan's clients at McKinsey, and she was hired by Kevin Johnson in 2003. In 2005, she became the Corporate Vice President of Customer Service and Support and in 2009, the Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Worldwide Services, which includes customer service, enterprise support and consulting with 20,000+ employees. That year the Profiles in Diversity Journal put her on its annual \"Women Worth Watching\" list.In November 2014, Hogan was appointed to executive vice president for Human Resources, replacing Lisa Brummel.  Although Hogan had never worked in HR before, she says her experience in leading the Worldwide Services division focused on attracting and retaining the best talent. Her diverse combination of experience, in technical, sales, and service, gave her credibility within the company.As Chief People Officer, her primary goal was to support the change in the company culture led by new CEO Satya Nadella, from a \"fixed mindset\" of competition, and trying to be the smartest person, to a \"growth mindset\" of learning, cooperation, diversity, and inclusion. The \"mindset\" methodology comes from the work of Stanford University psychology professor Carol Dweck. Dweck visited Microsoft in May 2016, met with Hogan and others, and was favorably impressed: unlike some other Fortune 500 companies that \"give lip service to growth mind-set\", Dweck says, \"I could see that they understood it deeply.\" In October 2016 Dweck and Hogan wrote an article together on how Microsoft uses growth mindset for Harvard Business Review.In 2014, as one of her first actions as Chief People Officer, Hogan sat down with human resource leads from rival companies, including Laszlo Bock from Google, and Denise Young Smith from Apple, Inc., to discuss the goal of increasing diversity in the technology industry. The collaborative meetings continued including HR leads from Intel, and Washington State companies outside the technology industry such as Starbucks and Costco. In further efforts to expand corporate diversity and inclusion, Hogan expanded parental leave benefit to all parents, including fathers, in 2015, and introduced a four-week paid family caregiver leave in 2017, making Microsoft one of the only companies to offer such a benefit worldwide. Hogan says these benefits are also personal for her, as she remembers the support she needed from her Services team when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007.",

He is the author of the Japanese book, Self-Actualization  and has been a full-time practicing psychiatrist in New York since 1976.\nIn 1969, when Ishizuka completed his residency in Boston, psychoanalysis was at its zenith in American psychiatry, with many professors having undergone psychoanalytical training. Harvard Professor David Riesman encouraged Ishizuka to undergo further training in psychoanalysis under Erich Fromm.   Impressed by Fromm's initial definition of health, but questioning that psycho-analytic psychology with its emphasis on one's past was clinically effective, Ishizuka hesitated.  Not convinced that undergoing seven years of psychoanalysis could help him better understand health or happiness, he left psychiatry.  His French wife, Colette, who later inspired much of his work on intimacy and the role a spouse or comparable intimate partner plays in it, supported his decision to follow his intuition.  In 1969 he joined McKinsey and Company, an international consulting firm, as an associate in Paris. In 1972, he left consulting to become President and Co-founder of a subsidiary of Mitsubishi International Corp for mergers and acquisitions. During his fourth year in M&A, a business colleague sought his advice on how to overcome depression.  Dr. Ishizuka's rewarding experience helping his friend led him to return to the field of psychiatry in 1976.  Ishizuka returned to medicine with a desire to understand what it meant to be well.",
        "Influences": "Ishizuka draws from the principles of both Zen Buddhism and quantum mechanics in his method of treatment.   While the latter emphasizes the interconnectedness of the entire universe, the former believes that a solution to human suffering lies in being one with the universe.  The process becoming one with the universe begins with being better related to, and experiencing a higher level of intimacy with, one's partner or wife and requires the latter's active participation.\u00bb and training in the West helped him develop a model of health across different cultures.Ishizuka, who graduated from Keio Medical School in Tokyo, and completed his residency in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School's Massachusetts Mental Health Center in 1969, has been a full-time practicing psychiatrist in New York since 1976.  He is the author of the Japanese book, Self-Actualization.Since 1976, Ishizuka\u2019s main contribution has been the development of a new paradigm of health including: \n\na full personality model that withstands the demanding criteria for mental health models set forth by Marie Jahoda\na hierarchy of defense which is mobilized when one's past experience and current capability to cope are exceeded by life challenges \na clinical approach that focuses on \u2018closeness\u2019 with a spouse or comparable partner for fundamental personality change \nthe use of crisis as an opportunity to  transform self, intimacy and achievement far beyond a previous best level of experience \na method of therapy Lifetrack, that defines, measures and enhances well-being as the central objective\nclinical insights  on self-actualization and fear, breakthrough intimacy, and stages of personality transformation under crisis",
        "Positive mental health": "In 1976, while many psychiatrists continued to be  preoccupied with the definition of psychological illnesses (Diagnostic Statistical Manuals), Ishizuka turned to a monograph by M. Jahoda published in 1958 entitled \u00ab Current Concepts of Positive Mental Health.\u00bb   Jahoda offered six conditions for developing and evaluating future models of Positive Mental Health.   In doing so, she pointed out the limits of the \u2018disease\u2019 model and set guidelines to define models of health applicable both in wellness and disease.   \nConcluding that the  \u2018medical\u2019 or \u2018disease model\u2019 used in psychiatry was not fit to understand healthy human beings or to assist them in \u2018normal\u2019 or optimal functioning, Ishizuka began to build such a model.  His exposure to the East, and training in the West helped him develop a model of health across different cultures. Focusing almost entirely on the experience of his diverse patients, he challenged what he knew to define a model of health and personality applicable both in extreme distress and optimal health.",
        "The three spheres: basic psychological needs and self-actualization": "In 1975, Dr. Ishizuka hypothesized that three basic psychological needs or spheres determine psychological health and self-actualization across cultures: the search for self, the need for intimacy, and the quest for achievement.  The three spheres, also referred to as the \"triad of psychological adjustment\" or \"tripod of happiness\"  are subjective, dynamic, and broad enough to encompass all psychological events.  These three interconnected spheres characterize a person's personality.  A prolonged imbalance or a crisis in any one of these three key interconnected spheres of mental health influences the others and can trigger defensive symptoms such as anxiety, anger, physical symptoms, depression or, in some cases, psychosis.",
        "Lifetrack Therapy: a personality model and therapy based on health": "To better understand and track psychological well-being, Ishizuka broke down the self, intimacy and achievement spheres into three dimensions with nine elements each. Using simple definitions and a subjective 10 point rating scale, he encouraged patients to take five to ten minutes daily to track the three spheres, as well as positive peaks of well-being (peace, friendliness, physical-health, happiness, mastery), negative peaks (anxiety, anger, physical symptoms, depression, psychosis), physical health, and proper use of food, beverage, or other substances.  This tripod model of mental health is the basis for Lifetrack Therapy, a clinical approach drawing on the experience and insights accumulated by the daily self-rating data of more than 1,200 patients throughout their treatment on 41 parameters of mental health through periods of crisis to optimal health.  The central goal for both the \u2018distressed\u201d and the \u201cwell\u201d in Lifetrack Therapy is the same: health and well-being in the primary three spheres of life.  Therapy sessions are focused on using crisis as an opportunity to transform the three spheres far beyond a previous best level of experience.",
        "Personal life": "Dr. Yukio Ishizuka has been happily married since 1966 to Colette Ducass\u00e9 Ishizuka.  He has three children, lives in New York, and is a member of Salmagundi Club of N.Y. as a resident artist since 1974.",

    "Kenneth E. Iverson": {
        "Introduction": "Kenneth Eugene Iverson (17 December 1920 \u2013 19 October 2004) was a Canadian computer scientist noted for the development of the programming language APL. He was honored with the Turing Award in 1979 \"for his pioneering effort in programming languages and mathematical notation resulting in what the computing field now knows as APL; for his contributions to the implementation of interactive systems, to educational uses of APL, and to programming language theory and practice\".",
        "Life": "Ken Iverson was born on 17 December 1920 near Camrose, a town in central Alberta, Canada. His parents were farmers who came to Alberta from North Dakota; his ancestors came from Trondheim, Norway.During World War II, he served first in the Canadian Army and then in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He received a B.A. degree from Queen's University and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University. In his career, he worked for Harvard, IBM, I. P. Sharp Associates, and Jsoftware Inc. (n\u00e9e Iverson Software Inc.).\nIverson suffered a stroke while working at the computer on a new J lab on 16 October 2004, and died in Toronto on 19 October 2004 at age 83.",
        "Education": "Iverson began school on 1 April 1926 in a one-room school, initially in Grade 1, promoted to Grade 2 after 3 months and to Grade 4 by the end of June 1927.\nHe left school after Grade 9 because it was the depths of the Great Depression and there was work to do on the family farm, and because he thought further schooling only led to becoming a schoolteacher and he had no desire to become one.  At age 17, while still out of school, he enrolled in a correspondence course on radios with De Forest Training in Chicago, and learned calculus by self-study from a textbook.\nDuring World War II, while serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, he took correspondence courses toward a high school diploma.\nAfter the war, Iverson enrolled in Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, taking advantage of government support for ex-servicemen and under threat from an Air Force buddy who said he would \"beat his brains out if he did not grasp the opportunity\". He graduated in 1950 as the top student with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics.Continuing his education at Harvard University, he began in the Department of Mathematics and received a Master's degree in 1951.  He then switched to the Department of Engineering and Applied Physics, working with Howard Aiken and Wassily Leontief.\n\nKenneth Iverson has recalled graduate study under Aiken as \"like an apprenticeship\" in which the student \"learned the tools of the scholarship trade\". Every topic was \"used more as a focus for the development of skills such as clarity of thought and expression than as an end in itself\". Once admitted to the program, a graduate student underwent a rite of \"adoption into the fold\". He was given a desk (or a share of a desk) among a group of other graduate students, the permanent staff, or visiting scholars, \"most of whom were engaged in some aspect of the design and building of computers\". A student was thus \"made to feel part of a scholarly enterprise\" and was provided, \"often for the first time, with easy and intimate access to others more experienced in his chosen field\".\nWhen interviewing Aiken, I had asked him whether Tropp and I might see his lecture notes; Aiken replied that he had always destroyed his lecture notes at the end of each year, so that he would not be tempted to repeat his lectures.\nHoward Aiken had developed the Harvard Mark I, one of the first large-scale digital computers, while Wassily Leontief was an economist who was developing the input\u2013output model of economic analysis, work for which he would later receive the Nobel prize. Leontief's model required large matrices and Iverson worked on programs that could evaluate these matrices on the Harvard Mark IV computer. Iverson received a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1954 with a dissertation based on this work.At Harvard, Iverson met Eoin Whitney, a 2-time Putnam Fellow and fellow graduate student from Alberta.  This had future ramifications.",
        "Work": "No information",
        "Harvard (1955\u20131960)": "Iverson stayed on at Harvard as an assistant professor to implement the world's first graduate program in \"automatic data processing\".\nMany people think that Aiken was interested only in scientific computers. This was simply not so. During one coffee hour, Aiken turned to Ken Iverson, who had just finished his Ph.D., and said: \"These machines are going to be immensely important for business, and I want you to prepare and teach a course in business data processing next fall.\" There had never been such a course anywhere in the world. Ken was qualified only because he was a mathematician. I was so excited by the prospect that I immediately volunteered to be Ken's graduate teaching assistant.\nIt was in this period that Iverson developed notation for describing and analyzing various topics in data processing, for teaching classes, and for writing (with Brooks) Automatic Data Processing. He was \"appalled\" to find that conventional mathematical notation failed to fill his needs, and began work on extensions to the notation that were more suitable.  In particular, he adopted the matrix algebra used in his thesis work, the systematic use of matrices and higher-dimensional arrays in tensor analysis, and operators in the sense of Heaviside in his treatment of Maxwell's equations, higher-order functions on function argument(s) with a function result.  The notation was also field-tested in the business world in 1957 during a 6-month sabbatical spent at McKinsey & Company. The first published paper using the notation was The Description of Finite Sequential Processes, initially Report Number 23 to Bell Labs and later revised and presented at the Fourth London Symposium on Information Theory in August 1960.Iverson stayed at Harvard for five years but failed to get tenure, because \"[he hadn't] published anything but the one little book\".",
        "IBM (1960\u20131980)": "Iverson joined IBM Research in 1960 (and doubled his salary). He was preceded to IBM by Fred Brooks, who advised him to \"stick to whatever [he] really wanted to do, because management was so starved for ideas that anything not clearly crazy would find support.\" In particular, he was allowed to finish and publish A Programming Language and (with Brooks) Automatic Data Processing, two books that described and used the notation developed at Harvard.  (Automatic Data Processing and A Programming Language began as one book \"but the material grew in both magnitude and level until a separation proved wise\".)\nAt IBM, Iverson soon met Adin Falkoff, and they worked together for the next twenty years.  Chapter 2 of A Programming Language used Iverson's notation to describe the IBM 7090 computer.  In early 1963 Falkoff, later joined by Iverson and Ed Sussenguth, proceeded to use the notation to produce a formal description of the IBM System/360 computer then under design. The result was published in 1964 in a double issue of the IBM Systems Journal, thereafter known as the \"grey book\" or \"grey manual\". The book was used in a course on computer systems design at the IBM Systems Research Institute. A consequence of the formal description was that it attracted the interest of bright young minds. One hotbed of interest was at Stanford University which included Larry Breed, Phil Abrams, Roger Moore, Charles Brenner, and Mike Jenkins, all of whom later made contributions to APL. Donald McIntyre, head of geology at Pomona College which had the first general customer installation of a 360 system, used the formal description to become more expert than the IBM systems engineer assigned to Pomona.With the completion of the formal description Falkoff and Iverson turned their attention to implementation. This work was brought to rapid fruition in 1965 when Larry Breed and Phil Abrams joined the project.  They produced a FORTRAN-based implementation on the 7090 called IVSYS (for Iverson system) by autumn 1965, first in batch mode and later, in early 1966, in time-shared interactive mode. Subsequently, Breed, Dick Lathwell (ex University of Alberta), and Roger Moore (of I. P. Sharp Associates) produced the System/360 implementation; the three received the Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1973 \"for their work in the design and implementation of APL\\360, setting new standards in simplicity, efficiency, reliability and response time for interactive systems.\" While the 360 implementation work was underway \"Iverson notation\" was renamed \"APL\", by Falkoff. The workspace \"1 cleanspace\" was saved at 1966-11-27 22.53.58 UTC. APL\\360 service began within IBM several weeks before that and outside IBM in 1968. Additional information on the implementation of APL\\360 can be found in the Acknowledgements of the APL\\360 User's Manual and in \"Appendix. Chronology of APL development\" of The Design of APL.\n\nThe formal description and especially the implementation drove the evolution of the language, a process of consolidation and regularization in typography, linearization, syntax, and function definition described in APL\\360 History, The Design of APL, and The Evolution of APL. Two treatises from this period, Conventions Governing the Order of Evaluation and Algebra as a Language, are apologias of APL notation.\nThe notation was used by Falkoff and Iverson to teach various topics at various universities and at the IBM Systems Research Institute. In 1964 Iverson used the notation in a one-semester course for seniors at the Fox Lane High School, and later in Swarthmore High School. After APL became available its first application was to teach formal methods in systems design at NASA Goddard. It was also used at the Hotchkiss School, Lower Canada College, Scotch Plains High School, Atlanta public schools, among others. In one school the students became so eager that they broke into the school after hours to get more APL computer time; in another the APL enthusiasts steered newbies to BASIC so as to maximize their own APL time.In 1969, Iverson and the APL group inaugurated the IBM Philadelphia Scientific Center. In 1970 he was named IBM Fellow. He used the funding that came with being an IBM Fellow to bring in visiting teachers and professors from various fields, including Donald McIntyre from  Pomona and Jeff Shallit as a summer student. For a period of several months the visitors would start using APL for expositions in their own fields, and the hope was that later they would continue their use of APL at their home institutions. Iverson's work at this time centered in several disciplines, including collaborative projects in circuit theory, genetics, geology, and calculus. When the PSC closed in 1974, some of the group transferred to California while others including Iverson remained in the East, later transferring back to IBM Research. He received the Turing Award in 1979.\n\nThe following table lists the publications which Iverson authored or co-authored while he was at IBM. They reflect the two main strands of his work.",
        "I. P. Sharp Associates (1980\u20131987)": "In 1980, Iverson left IBM for I. P. Sharp Associates, an APL time-sharing company.  He was preceded there by his IBM colleagues Paul Berry, Joey Tuttle, Dick Lathwell, and Eugene McDonnell.  At IPSA, the APL language and systems group was managed by Eric Iverson (Ken Iverson's son); Roger Moore, one of the APL\\360 implementers, was a vice president.\nIverson worked to develop and extend APL on the lines presented in Operators and Functions. The language work gained impetus in 1981 when Arthur Whitney and Iverson produced a model of APL written in APL at the same time they were working on IPSA's OAG database. (Iverson introduced Arthur Whitney, son of Eoin Whitney, to APL when he was 11-years-old and in 1974 recommended him for a summer student position at IPSA Calgary.) In the model, the APL syntax was driven by an 11-by-5 table.  Whitney also invented the rank operator in the process. The language design was further simplified and extended in Rationalized APL in January 1983, multiple editions of A Dictionary of the APL Language between 1984 and 1987, and A Dictionary of APL in September 1987. Within IPSA, the phrase \"dictionary APL\" came into use to denote the APL specified by A Dictionary of APL, itself referred to as \"the dictionary\".  In the dictionary, APL syntax is controlled by a 9-by-6 table and the parsing process was precisely and succinctly described in Table 2, and there is a primitive (monadic \u22a5, modeled in APL) for word formation (lexing).\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the main APL vendors were IBM, STSC, and IPSA, and all three were active in developing and extending the language. IBM had APL2, based on the work of Jim Brown. Work on APL2 proceeded intermittently for 15 years, with actual coding starting in 1971 and APL2 becoming available as an IUP (Installed User Program, an IBM product classification) in 1982. STSC had an experimental APL system called NARS, designed and implemented by Bob Smith. NARS and APL2 differed in fundamental respects from dictionary APL, and differed from each other.\nI.P. Sharp implemented the new APL ideas in stages: complex numbers, enclosed (boxed) arrays, match, and composition operators in 1981, the determinant operator in 1982, and the rank operator, link, and the left and right identity functions in 1983. However, the domains of operators were still restricted to the primitive functions or subsets thereof. In 1986, IPSA developed SAX, SHARP APL/Unix, written in C and based on an implementation by STSC. The language was as specified in the dictionary with no restrictions on the domains of operators.  An alpha version of SAX became available within I.P. Sharp around December 1986 or early 1987.\nIn education, Iverson developed A SHARP APL Minicourse used to teach IPSA clients in the use of APL, and Applied Mathematics for Programmers and Mathematics and Programming which were used in computer science courses at T.H. Twente.\n\nPublications which Iverson authored or co-authored while he was at I. P. Sharp Associates:",
        "Jsoftware (1990\u20132004)": "Iverson retired from I. P. Sharp Associates in 1987.  He kept busy while \"between jobs\".  Regarding language design, the most significant of his activities in this period was the invention of \"fork\" in 1988.  For years, he had struggled to find a way to write f+g as in calculus, from the \"scalar operators\" in 1978, through the \"til\" operator in 1982, the catenation and reshape operators in 1984, the union and intersection operators in 1987, \"yoke\" in 1988, and finally forks in 1988. Forks are defined as follows:\n\nMoreover, (f g p q r) \u2190\u2192 (f g (p q r)). Thus to write f+g as in calculus, one can write f+g in APL. Iverson and Eugene McDonnell worked out the details on the long plane rides to the APL88 conference in Sydney, Australia, with Iverson coming up with the initial idea on waking up from a nap.:\u200a\u00a71.3,\u200a\u00a73.8\u200aIverson presented the rationale for his work post 1987 as follows:\nWhen I retired from paid employment, I turned my attention back to this matter [the use of APL for teaching] and soon concluded that the essential tool required was a dialect of APL that:\n\u2022 Is available as \"shareware\", and is inexpensive enough to be acquired by students as well as by schools\n\u2022 Can be printed on standard printers\n\u2022 Runs on a wide variety of computers\n\u2022 Provides the simplicity and the generality of the latest thinking in APL\nThe result has been J, first reported in [the APL 90 Conference Proceedings].\nRoger Hui described the final impetus that got J started in Appendix A of An Implementation of J:\nOne summer weekend in 1989, Arthur Whitney visited Ken Iverson at Kiln Farm and produced\u2014on one page and in one afternoon\u2014an interpreter fragment on the AT&T 3B1 computer. I studied this interpreter for about a week for its organization and programming style; and on Sunday, August 27, 1989, at about four o'clock in the afternoon, wrote the first line of code that became the implementation described in this document.\nArthur's one-page interpreter fragment is as follows: ...\nHui, a classmate of Whitney at the University of Alberta, had studied A Dictionary of the APL Language when he was between jobs, modelled the parsing process in at least two different ways, and investigated uses of dictionary APL in diverse applications. As well, from January 1987 to August 1989 he had access to SAX, and in the later part of that period used it on a daily basis.J initially took A Dictionary of APL as the specification, and the J interpreter was built around Table 2 of the dictionary. The C data and program structures were designed so that the parse table in C corresponded directly to the parse table in the dictionary.  In retrospect, Iverson's APL87 paper APL87, in five pages, prescribed all the essential steps in writing an APL interpreter, in particular the sections on word formation and parsing.  Arthur Whitney, in addition to the \"one-page thing\", contributed to J development by suggesting that primitives be oriented on the leading axis, that agreement (a generalization of scalar extension) should be prefix instead of suffix, and that a total array ordering be defined.One of the objectives was to implement fork. This turned out to be rather straightforward, by the inclusion of one additional row in the parse table. The choice to implement forks was fortuitous and fortunate. It was realized only later that forks made tacit expressions (operator expressions) complete in the following sense: any sentence involving one or two arguments that did not use its arguments as an operand, can be written tacitly with fork, compose, the left and right identity functions, and constant functions.\nTwo obvious differences between J and other APL dialects are: (a) its use of terms from natural languages instead of from mathematics or computer science (the practice began with A Dictionary of APL): noun, verb, adverbs, alphabet, word formation, sentence, ... instead of array, function, operator, character set, lexing, expression, ... ; and (b) its use of 7-bit ASCII characters instead of special symbols.  Other differences between J and APL are described in J for the APL Programmer and APL and J.The J source code is available from Jsoftware under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL3), or a commercial alternative.Eric Iverson founded Iverson Software Inc., in February 1990 to provide an improved SHARP APL/PC product. It quickly became obvious that there were shared interests and goals, and in May 1990 Iverson and Hui joined Iverson Software Inc.; later joined by Chris Burke. The company soon became J only. The name was changed to Jsoftware Inc., in April 2000.\n\nPublications which Iverson authored or co-authored while he was at Iverson Software Inc. and Jsoftware Inc.:",

        "Introduction": "Piyush \"Bobby\" Jindal (born June 10, 1971) is an American politician who served as the 55th governor of Louisiana from 2008 to 2016. The only living former Louisiana governor, Jindal also served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and Chairman of the Republican Governors Association.In 1995, Jindal was appointed secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. In 1999, he was appointed president of the University of Louisiana System. At 28, Jindal became the youngest person to hold the position. In 2001, President George W. Bush appointed Jindal as principal adviser to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services.Jindal first ran for governor of Louisiana in 2003, but narrowly lost in the run-off election to Democratic candidate Kathleen Blanco. In 2004, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the second Indian American in Congress, and he was reelected in 2006. To date, he is the only Indian-American Republican to have ever served in Congress. Jindal ran for governor again in the 2007 election and won. Jindal was re-elected in 2011 in a landslide, winning more than 65 percent of the vote. He was the first Indian American governor, and the only one until Nikki Haley was elected Governor of South Carolina in 2010.On June 24, 2015, Jindal announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election. He suspended his campaign in November 2015, subsequently announcing his support for Marco Rubio. He finished his term as governor in January 2016.",
        "Early life and education": "Piyush Jindal was born on June 10, 1971 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to immigrant Punjabi Hindu parents. He is the first of two sons of Raj (n\u00e9e Gupta) and Amar Jindal, from Punjab, India. His father is a civil engineer and graduate of Guru Nanak Dev University and Punjab University. His mother is a graduate of Rajasthan University and worked in nuclear physics at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh. Before migrating to the United States, both his parents were lecturers at an Indian engineering college.At the time of their move to the U.S., Raj Jindal was to be a doctoral candidate in physics. They left Malerkotla, Punjab in January 1971, six months before their son was born. Jindal's paternal grandfather was a merchant from Khanpur, Samrala and his maternal grandfather was a Ferozepur banker.The family settled near Louisiana State University. Jindal attended Baton Rouge Magnet High School, graduating in 1988. While in high school, he competed in tennis tournaments, started various enterprises such as a computer newsletter, retail candy business, and a mail-order software company. He spent free time working in the stands at LSU football games.Jindal graduated from Brown University in 1992 at the age of 20, with honors in two majors, biology and public policy.Jindal was admitted to the Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME), guaranteeing him a place at Brown Medical School. He did not pursue his Medical Doctorate. Jindal has been credited with leading Brown University's College Republicans student group.Jindal was named to the 1992 USA Today All-USA Academic Team. He applied to and was accepted by both Harvard Medical School and Yale Law School, but studied as a Rhodes Scholar where he received an MLitt in political science with an emphasis in health policy from New College, Oxford in 1994. The subject of his thesis was \"A needs-based approach to health care\".",
        "Career": "After completing his studies at Oxford, Jindal turned down an offer to study for a D.Phil. in politics, instead joining the consulting firm McKinsey & Company. He then interned in the office of Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, where McCrery assigned him to work on healthcare policy; Jindal spent two weeks studying Medicare to compile an extensive report on possible solutions to Medicare's financial problems, which he presented to McCrery.",
        "Early political career (1996\u20132003)": "No information",
        "Foster administration": "In 1993, U.S. Representative Jim McCrery (whom Jindal had worked for as a summer intern) introduced him to Governor Mike Foster. In 1996, Foster appointed Jindal as Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, an agency that represented about 40 percent of the state budget and employed over 12,000 people. Foster called Jindal a genius who had a great deal of medical knowledge. Jindal was 24 at the time.During his tenure, Louisiana's Medicaid program went from bankruptcy with a $400 million deficit into three years of surpluses totaling $220 million.Jindal was criticized during the 2007 campaign by the Louisiana AFL\u2013CIO for closing some local clinics to reach that surplus. Under Jindal's term, Louisiana nationally rose to third place in child healthcare screenings, with child immunizations rising, and introduced new and expanded services for the elderly and the disabled.In 1998, Jindal was appointed executive director of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, a 17-member panel charged with devising plans to reform Medicare. In 1999, at the request of the Louisiana governor's office and the Louisiana State Legislature, Jindal examined how Louisiana might use its $4.4 billion share of the tobacco settlement.In 1998, Jindal received the Samuel S. Beard Award for greatest public service by an individual 35 years old or under, an award given annually by Jefferson Awards.At 28 years of age in 1999, Jindal was appointed to become the youngest-ever president of the University of Louisiana System, the nation's 16th largest system of higher education with over 80,000 students.",
        "Bush administration": "In March 2001, he was nominated by President George W. Bush to be Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Planning and Evaluation. He was later unanimously confirmed by a vote of the United States Senate and began serving on July 9, 2001. In that position, he served as the principal policy adviser to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. He resigned from that post on February 21, 2003, to return to Louisiana and run for governor. He was assigned to help fight the nurse shortage by examining steps to improve nursing education.",
        "2003 election for governor": "Jindal came to national prominence during the 2003 election for governor of Louisiana. In what Louisianans call an \"open primary\" (but which is technically a nonpartisan blanket primary), Jindal finished first with 33 percent of the vote. He received endorsements from the largest paper in Louisiana, the Times-Picayune; the newly elected Democratic mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin; and the outgoing Republican governor, Mike Foster.In the second balloting, Jindal faced the outgoing lieutenant governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Lafayette, a Democrat. Despite winning in Blanco's hometown, he lost many normally conservative parishes in north Louisiana, and Blanco prevailed with 52 percent of the popular vote.Some political analysts blamed Jindal's loss for his refusal to answer questions targeted at his religion and ethnic background brought up in several Democratic advertisements, which the Jindal campaign called \"negative attack ads.\" Despite losing the election in 2003, the run for governor made Jindal a well-known figure on the state's political scene and a rising star within the Republican Party.",

        "Elections": "No information",
        "2004": "A few weeks after the 2003 gubernatorial runoff, Jindal decided to run for Louisiana's 1st congressional district. The incumbent, David Vitter, was running for the Senate seat being vacated by John Breaux. The Louisiana Republican Party endorsed him in the primary although Mike Rogers, also a Republican, was running for the same seat. The 1st District has been in Republican hands since a 1977 special election and is widely considered to be staunchly conservative. Jindal's campaign was able to raise over $1 million very early in the campaign, making it harder for other candidates to effectively raise funds to oppose him. He won the 2004 election with 78 percent of the vote.Jindal was only the second Indian-American to be elected to the United States Congress, after Dalip Singh Saund was elected in November 1955.",
        "2006": "Jindal won re-election to a second term with 88% of the vote.",
        "Congressional tenure": "He was the second Indian American elected to Congress. He has reportedly lived in Kenner, Metairie, and Baton Rouge.In 2005, Jindal criticized Bush's budget for not calling for enough spending cuts. He warned of the growth of Medicaid saying \"Congress may act without them...there seems to be growing momentum that the status quo is not defensible.\" Jindal praised Bush's leadership on social security reform, saying \"The administration has a lot more work to do to continue educating the American people about the very serious challenges facing Social Security.\"In response to Hurricane Katrina, Jindal stated \"If we had been investing resources in restoring our coast, it wouldn't have prevented the storm, but the barrier islands would have absorbed some of the tidal surge.\"",
        "Committee assignments": "House Committee on Homeland Security\nHouse Committee on Resources\nHouse Committee on Education and the WorkforceHe was made vice-chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Prevention of Nuclear and Biological Attacks. Jindal served as president of the incoming freshman class of congressmen, in 2004. He was elected to the position of House assistant majority whip, a senior leadership role. He served in this capacity from 2004 to 2006.",
        "2007 gubernatorial election": "On January 22, 2007, Jindal announced his candidacy for governor. Polling data showed him with an early lead in the race, and he remained the favorite throughout the campaign. He defeated eleven opponents in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 20, including two prominent Democrats, State Senator Walter Boasso of Chalmette and Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell of Bossier City, and an independent, New Orleans businessman John Georges.\nJindal finished with 699,672 votes (54 percent). Boasso ran second with 226,364 votes (17 percent). Georges finished with 186,800 (14 percent), and Campbell, who is also a former state senator, ran fourth with 161,425 (12 percent). The remaining candidates collectively polled three percent of the vote. Jindal polled well in the pluralities or majorities in 60 of the state's 64 parishes (equivalent to counties in other states). He lost narrowly to Georges in Orleans Parish, to Boasso in St. Bernard Parish (which Boasso represented in the Legislature), and in the two neighboring north Louisiana parishes of Red River and Bienville located south of Shreveport, both historically Democratic and supported Campbell. In the 2003 contest with Blanco, Jindal had lost most of the northern parishes. This marked the first time that a non-incumbent candidate for governor was elected without a runoff under the Louisiana election system.",
        "Governor of Louisiana (2008\u20132016)": "No information",
        "First term": "As governor-elect, Jindal named a new ethics team, with Democratic Shreveport businesswoman Virginia Kilpatrick Shehee, the first woman to have served in the state senate, as the vice-chairman of the panel. Jindal assumed the position of governor when he took the oath of office on January 14, 2008. At thirty-six, he became the youngest sitting governor in the United States. He is also Louisiana's first non-white governor since P. B. S. Pinchback served for thirty-five days during Reconstruction, and the first non-white governor to be elected (Pinchback succeeded to the position of lieutenant governor on the death of Oscar Dunn, then to governor upon the impeachment of Henry Clay Warmoth). Additionally, Jindal became the first Indian American to be elected governor of any state in the United States.  In a salute to the 2007 LSU Tigers football national championship team during his January 14, 2008 inauguration speech, Jindal stated in part \"...They revere our athletes. Go Tigers....\"In 2008, Jindal was ranked one of the nation's most popular governors with an approval rating of 77%.One of Jindal's first appointments was that of Mike Edmonson as superintendent of the Louisiana State Police. Edmonson had been for twenty preceding years the bodyguard and confidant of LSU Tigers football coaches. Edmonson was also the deputy secretary of the Department of Public Safety, an agency with more than 2,900 employees and a budget of nearly $500 million.In 2014, Jindal was compelled to urge repeal of a state law that he had earlier signed which provided enhanced retirement benefits to Edmonson and, inadvertently, to one other state trooper. Jindal said that he was unaware that the legislation, called in the media the \"Edmonson Act,\" applied only to two persons. He urged the legislature to rewrite the law. Thereafter, Janice Clark, a state district court judge in Baton Rouge, declared that portion of the law enhancing the retirement benefits of Edmonson to be unconstitutional.Another early appointee was that of former state representative Frank P. Simoneaux, a Baton Rouge attorney, as the chairman of the Louisiana Ethics Commission. Jimmy Faircloth, an attorney from Alexandria and Pineville, was the influential executive counsel from 2008 to 2009, when he stepped down to run unsuccessfully for the Louisiana Supreme Court. Faircloth was considered the legal architect of the special 2008 legislative session on ethics reform. He guided the Jindal administration through the aftermath of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. After leaving the administration, he continued as a periodic legal advisor to Jindal.\n\nOn June 27, 2008, Louisiana's Secretary of State confirmed that a recall petition had been filed against Jindal in response to Jindal's refusal to veto a bill that would have more than doubled the current state legislative pay. During his gubernatorial campaign, Jindal had pledged to prevent legislative pay raises that would take effect during the current term.Jindal responded by saying that he is opposed to the pay increase, but that he had pledged to let the legislature govern themselves.On June 30, 2008, Jindal reversed his earlier position by vetoing the pay raise legislation, stating that he made a mistake by staying out of the pay raise issue. In response, the petitioners dropped their recall effort.Standard and Poor's raised Louisiana's bond rating and credit outlook from stable to positive in 2009. In announcing this change, the organization gave credit to the state's strong management and \"commitment to streamlining its government functions.\" Jindal met with President Barack Obama in October 2009 where the governor pushed for increased federal dollars to cover rising Medicaid costs, speeding the construction of hurricane-protection barriers, and financing the proposed Louisiana State University teaching hospital. During a town hall meeting, Obama praised Jindal as a \"hard working man who is doing a good job\" for the State, and expressed support for the governor's overhaul of the State's educational system in the area of increased charter schools.Louisiana state government watchdog C.B. Forgotston, former counsel to the House Appropriations Committee who supported Jindal's election in 2007, has expressed disappointment with the governor in regard to the legislative pay raise and other fiscal issues. Forgotston said he would grade Jindal an A+ in public relations and a D in fiscal performance in office.Jindal negotiated an agreement whereby Foster Farms, a private chicken processor, would receive $50 million in taxpayer funds to purchase a chicken processing plant owned by bankrupt Pilgrim's Pride.Some claimed there is a conflict of interest in that Pilgrim's Pride founder Lonnie \"Bo\" Pilgrim contributed $2500 to Jindal's campaign in 2007. Other contributors to Jindal's campaign who benefited from economic development spending include Albemarle and Edison Chouest Offshore. Jindal however released a statement saying that this legislation saved over 1,000 jobs, serves as a stimulus to Louisiana's economy, and had wide bipartisan support.",
        "Hurricane Gustav": "Jindal oversaw one of the largest evacuations in U.S. history (nearly two million people) in late August 2008 prior to the Louisiana landfall of Hurricane Gustav. He issued mandatory evacuation orders for the state's coastal areas and activated 3,000 National Guardsman to aid in the exodus. He also ordered the state to purchase generators to provide needed power to hospitals and nursing homes without power. Government officials vacated hospitals and nursing homes and put the poor, the ill, and the elderly on buses and trains out of town. The evacuation was credited as one reason that Gustav resulted in only 16 deaths in the U.S. The state's successful response to Hurricane Gustav was in stark contrast to the failed hurricane response system for Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Jindal received bipartisan praise for his leadership during Gustav. Jindal had been scheduled to address the Republican National Convention, but cancelled his plans in order to focus on Louisiana's needs during the storm.",
        "2011 re-election campaign": "Jindal announced his intention to seek reelection in 2011. With high approval ratings and big amounts of campaign funds, Democrats struggled to land a recruit of any substance. Running against four Democrats, a Libertarian and four independents in the jungle primary, Jindal received 66% of the vote in the blanket primary, thereby winning election in the first round.",
        "Second term": "In August 2011, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) awarded Jindal the Thomas Jefferson Freedom Award for \"outstanding public service\".On October 25, 2011, in preparing for his second term, Jindal tapped Republican state representative Chuck Kleckley of Lake Charles and State Senator John Alario of Westwego as his choices for Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives and Louisiana Senate President, respectively. Both were confirmed by legislators. Alario is a long-term Democrat who switched parties prior to the 2011 elections. In January 2012, Jindal elevated John C. White, the short-term superintendent at the Recovery School District in New Orleans, to the position of state superintendent of education.In August 2012, Jindal declared a statewide state of emergency due to the threat of subsidence and subsurface instability that threatens the lives and property of the citizens of the state.By the end of Jindal's second term, he saw a marked drop in his state popularity and problems such as a budget deficit and cuts to public expenditure.  He could not stand for a third term because the governor of Louisiana is subject to term limits.",
        "Tax system proposals": "In January 2013, Jindal released a plan that would eliminate the Louisiana state income tax, which he felt would expand business investment in the state, and then raise sales taxes in order to keep the plan revenue-neutral. Self-styled taxpayer watchdog and former legislative aide C.B. Forgotston correctly predicted that Jindal's plan would fail to clear the legislature because of the higher sales taxes, the lack of needed support from Democrats, and the likelihood that the plan would not increase overall state revenues.On April 8, 2013, the first day of the legislative session, Jindal dropped the plan after acknowledging some negative response to the plan from legislators and the public, but said he would still like the legislature to formulate its own plan that could end the state income tax.",
        "Energy plan": "Jindal announced, in September 2014, a six-point energy platform that would, among other things, open up energy production on federal land and eliminated proposed carbon restrictions.",
        "Retirement from politics (2016\u2013present)": "In 2017, Jindal took a position as an operating adviser for Ares Management, a global investment firm based in Los Angeles.",
        "National politics": "No information",
        "Speculation about 2008 vice presidential nomination": "On February 8, 2008, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh mentioned on his syndicated show that Jindal could be a possible choice for the Republican vice presidential nomination in 2008. He said that Jindal might be perceived as an asset to John McCain's campaign because he has wide support in the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party and his immigrant past offsets McCain's white heritage. If McCain had won the presidency, he would have been the oldest president ever inaugurated to a first term.Heightening the speculation, McCain invited Jindal, Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and McCain's former rivals Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee to meet at McCain's home in Arizona on May 23, 2008, according to a Republican familiar with the decision; Romney, Huckabee, and Pawlenty, all of whom were already well acquainted with McCain, declined because of prior commitments. The meeting may have served a different purpose, such as consideration of Jindal for the opportunity to speak at the 2008 Republican National Convention, in a similar fashion to Barack Obama at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, cementing a place for him in the party and opening the gate for a future run for the presidency. Speculation was fueled by simultaneous July 21, 2008, reports that McCain was making a sudden visit to Louisiana to confer again with Jindal and that McCain was readying to name his running mate within a week. However, on July 23, 2008, Jindal said that he would not be the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2008. Jindal added that he \"never talked to the senator [McCain] about the vice presidency or his thoughts on selecting the vice president.\" Ultimately, on August 29, 2008, McCain chose then-Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate. While Jindal was given a prime-time speech slot at the party convention, he was not offered the keynote speech. During the presidential campaign, Jindal expressed admiration for both Senators McCain and Obama, and maintained that both have made positive contributions to the nation.",
        "Republican response to President Obama's address to Congress": "On February 24, 2009, Jindal delivered the official Republican response to President Obama's address to a joint session of Congress. Jindal called the president's economic stimulus plan \"irresponsible\" and argued against government intervention. He used Hurricane Katrina to warn against government solutions to the economic crisis. \"Today in Washington, some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us,\" Jindal said. \"Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina, we have our doubts.\" He praised the late sheriff Harry Lee for standing up to the government during Katrina.The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as \"devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country\", political commentator Rachel Maddow summarized Jindal's Katrina remark as follows: \"[Jindal states that] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government should not be allowed to fail again, but that government...never works. That government can't work, and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government.\" David Johnson, a Republican political strategist criticized Jindal's mention of Hurricane Katrina, stating \"The one thing Republicans want to forget is Katrina.\" While Jindal's speech was poorly received by several Democratic and Republican critics, others argued that the speech should be judged on substance rather than delivery style.Jindal's story of meeting Lee in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was questioned following the speech, as Jindal was not in New Orleans at the time. On February 27, 2009, a spokesman for Jindal clarified the timing of the meeting, stating that the story took place days after the storm. The opportunity to give the response to President Obama's speech was compared by some commentators to winning \"second prize in a beauty contest\", a reference to the board game Monopoly.",
        "2012 presidential election": "Jindal had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential election. On December 10, 2008, Jindal indicated that he would likely not run for president in 2012, saying he will focus on his re-election in 2011 and that this would make transitioning to a national campaign difficult, though he did not rule out a possible 2012 presidential bid.\nSpeculation increased when Republicans chose Jindal to deliver the response to President Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress.The Jindal for President Draft Council Inc. PAC was formed in 2009 to raise funds for a future presidential run. Jindal has stated that he has no involvement with the PAC. In April 2010, while speaking at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, Jindal ruled out running for the Republican nomination for president in 2012.In 2012, Jindal traveled across the country in support of the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket. Because Louisiana and other Deep South states voted heavily for the GOP, Jindal could hence devote his campaign time elsewhere. In August 2012, Politico reported that \"Bobby Jindal would be considered [for] and would likely take\" appointment as United States Secretary of Health and Human Services in a potential Romney cabinet.After the defeat of Romney-Ryan, Jindal called for his party to return to \"the basics... If we want people to like us, we have to like them first,\" he said on the interview program Fox News Sunday.  As the incoming president of the Republican Governors Association, which had thirty members in 2013, Jindal questioned Romney for having criticized President Obama as having provided \"extraordinary financial gifts from the government\". In reply to Romney, Jindal said, \"You don't start to like people by insulting them and saying their votes were bought.\" Jindal said that his party must convince a majority of voters that it supports the middle class and the principle of upward mobility. He also criticized what he termed \"stupid\" remarks regarding rape and conception made in 2012 by defeated Republican U.S. Senate nominees Todd Akin in Missouri and Richard Mourdock in Indiana.",
        "2016 presidential candidacy": "In November 2012, after the election, Jindal was featured in a Time magazine article titled \"2016: Let's Get The Party Started\", where he was listed as a possible Republican candidate for the presidency in 2016. The article cited his fiscal and social conservative policies and his Indian American background, which would bring diversity to the GOP.In 2013, with polls showing Jindal's approval ratings in Louisiana falling significantly, some analysts wrote off Jindal as a serious national contender, though others pointed to Romney as an example of someone who still won the Presidential nomination despite poor approval ratings from his home state. In October 2013, Jindal told Fox News Sunday that he was still mulling a 2016 presidential run.On May 18, 2015, Jindal formed a presidential exploratory committee to determine whether he would run as a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, and he announced his candidacy on June 24.As of early September, Jindal was polling at 1 percent among the Republican primary electorate. On November 17, 2015, Jindal appeared on Special Report with Bret Baier on the Fox News Channel, announcing that he was ending his run for president, saying \"I've come to the realization that this is not my time.\"During his campaign, Jindal called Donald Trump a \"narcissist\" and an \"egomaniacal madman\", but afterward said that he would support Trump because \"electing Donald Trump would be the second-worst thing we could do this November, better only than electing Hillary Clinton to serve as the third term for the Obama administration's radical policies.\"",

        "Abortion and stem cell research": "Jindal has a 100% anti-abortion voting record according to the National Right to Life Committee. He opposes abortion in general, but does not condemn medical procedures aimed at saving the life of the mother that indirectly result in the loss of the unborn child, such as salpingectomy for an ectopic pregnancy.In 2003, Jindal stated that he did not object to the use of emergency contraception in the case of rape if the victim requests it. While in the House of Representatives, he supported two bills to prohibit transporting minors across state lines to obtain an abortion; the bills aimed to prevent doctors and others from helping a minor avoid parental notification laws in their home state by procuring an abortion in another state. He opposed and voted against expanding public funding of embryonic stem cell research.",
        "Same-sex marriage": "Jindal opposed the legalization of both same-sex marriage and civil unions. In Congress, he voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment to restrict marriage to a union between one man and one woman. He also voted against the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. In December 2008, Jindal announced the formation of the Louisiana Commission on Marriage and Family.Following the 2013 Supreme Court's rulings on DOMA and Proposition 8, he said: \"I believe every child deserves a mom and a dad. This opinion leaves the matter of marriage to the states where people can decide. In Louisiana, we will opt for traditional marriage. How about we let the people decide for themselves, via their representatives and via referendum?\"",
        "Marriage and Conscience Act": "In April 2015, Jindal announced that he would sign into law the Louisiana Marriage and Conscience Act proposed by newly elected Republican state representative Mike Johnson. In a guest editorial in The New York Times, Jindal said that he has been contacted by several corporations who oppose the bill: \"They are free to voice their opinions, but they will not deter me.\" Johnson's bill proposed to bar the state from revoking licenses or refusing to engage in contract with individuals or businesses because they oppose marriage between two persons of the same sex. Johnson's bill was meant to guarantee the tax status of groups that support only traditional marriage. In May 2015, the legislature killed the measure. Four Republican members, Pete Huval of Breaux Bridge, Gregory A. Miller of Norco, Clay Schexnayder of Gonzales, and Nancy Landry of Lafayette, joined Democrats in killing the bill. Jindal responded by issuing Executive Order BJ-2015-8, (the \"Marriage and Conscience Order\"), which attempted to achieve the goals of the failed legislation. Johnson said he intended to re-introduce the measure in 2016.",
        "Government ethics": "He vetoed state legislation to increase pay for state legislators. However, the Louisiana governor's office was ranked last for transparency in the United States both prior, and subsequent, to Jindal's election, as reported by the WDSU I-Team. At least two legislators, state representatives Walker Hines and Neil Abramson, argued that this may be attributed to legislation that removed the governor's records from the public domain; they argued that the legislation was surreptitiously inserted as a last-minute amendment into an education bill by Jindal's office on the last day of the 2008 session, providing no time to properly review it before it passed the legislature and was signed into law by Jindal.In 2014, Jindal signed into law a bill sponsored by Democratic state representative Jeff Arnold of New Orleans to permit Francis C. Heitmeier, a Democratic former member of both houses of the Louisiana Legislature and an unsuccessful 2006 candidate for Louisiana Secretary of State, to lobby legislators even though Heitmeier's brother, David Heitmeier, was, at the time, the sitting senator for District 7, which includes the Algiers neighbourhood of New Orleans. The special exemption permitted an immediate family member of an elected official who was a lobbyist for the executive branch of state government for the year prior to 9 January 2012, to be able to lobby the legislature. David Heitmeier abstained from voting on the measure which was written with the intent of benefiting Francis Heitmeier.",
        "Gun rights and gun control": "Jindal is a fervent supporter of the Second Amendment and generally opposes gun control. He has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association and received an A rating from Gun Owners of America while he was in Congress.As a Congressman, he sponsored the Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006 with Senator Vitter.\nIn July 2015, during an interview with CBS, Jindal stated that he supported stricter background checks, and that every state should begin to enact tougher background checks on gun buyers.",
        "Tax policy": "As a private citizen, Jindal voted in 2002 for the Louisiana constitutional amendment known as the Stelly Plan which lowered some sales taxes in exchange for higher income taxes. After taking office, Jindal cut taxes a total of six times, including the largest income tax cut in Louisiana's history \u2013 a cut of $1.1 billion over five years, along with accelerating the elimination of the tax on business investments. In January 2013, Jindal said he wanted to eliminate all Louisiana corporate and personal income taxes, without giving details for his proposal.As U.S. Representative from Louisiana, Jindal received grades of B in 2005, B\u2212 in 2006, and C in 2007 from the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative taxpayers advocacy organization. As Governor of Louisiana, Jindal received grades of A in 2010, B in 2012, and B in 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors.",
        "Education": "In 2008, Jindal came out in favour of the Common Core State Standards Initiative, which Louisiana adopted in 2010.In 2014, Jindal wrote that \"It has become fashionable in the news media to believe there is a right-wing conspiracy against Common Core.\"Jindal proposed budgets that impose cuts on higher education funding in Louisiana, leading to protests from students and education advocates. Jindal proposed several controversial education reforms, including vouchers for low income students in public schools to attend private institutions using Minimum Foundation Program funds.The legislation also included controversial changes in teacher evaluations, tenure and pensions. Hundreds of teachers, administrators and public education supporters protested against the legislation at the capital of Louisiana, some of whom cancelled classes to attend demonstrations. Many participants circulated petitions to recall Jindal and Republican House Speaker Chuck Kleckley. In April 2012, a Louisiana Public Broadcasting program examined possible conflicts between aspects of the Jindal education reform plan and the federal desegregation orders still in place in many parts of Louisiana.Jindal said he believed that every child learns differently. For him, some will accomplish great things in a public school while some will learn better in an online program, and still others will make waves in charter schools, or in parochial schools and dual-enrollment programmes. However, in all these choices, the parents must be trusted to make the best decisions for their children.",
        "Evolution": "Jindal signed a law that permitted teachers at public schools to supplement standard evolutionary curricula with analysis and critiques that may include intelligent design. The law forbids \"the promotion of any religious doctrine and will not discriminate against religion or non-religion\". Louisiana ACLU Director Marjorie Esman said that if the act was utilized as written, it would be on firm constitutional footing, stating that the Act is \"susceptible to a constitutional challenge.\" Despite calls for a veto from John Derbyshire and some genetics professors at Brown University, Jindal signed the Louisiana Academic Freedom Act which passed with a vote of 94\u20133 in the State House and 35\u20130 in the State Senate in 2008.The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology rejected New Orleans as a site for their 2010 meeting and the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology will not conduct future meetings in Louisiana.",
        "Civil liberties": "Jindal voted to extend the Patriot Act, voted in favour of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, supported a constitutional amendment banning flag burning, and voted for the Real ID Act of 2005.In the 2009 legislative session, Jindal expressed support for a bill by state representative James H. Morris of Oil City, which would permit motorcyclists to choose whether or not to wear a helmet. Morris' bill easily passed the House but was blocked in the\nSenate Health Committee.",
        "Immigration laws": "He criticized illegal immigration as a drain on the economy, as well as being unfair to those who entered the country by legal means. He voted to build a fence along the Mexican border and opposed granting amnesty for illegal immigrants.",
        "Health care": "Jindal refused to accept federal funds to expand Medicaid after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, costing his state $1.65 billion in federal health-care assistance for the poor. He supported increased health insurance portability; laws promoting coverage of pre-existing medical conditions; a cap on malpractice lawsuits; an easing of restrictions on importation of prescription medications; the implementation of a streamlined electronic medical records system; an emphasis on preventative care rather than emergency room care; and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. During Jindal tenure, over 11,000 uninsured children were added to the State's Children's Health Insurance Program. He also opposed a federal government-run, single-payer system, but supported state efforts to reduce the uninsured population. He has also supported expanding services for autistic children, and promoted a national childhood cancer database. In collaboration with Health Secretary Alan Levine, Jindal drafted the Louisiana Health First Initiative. This plan focused on expanding health insurance coverage for the state's indigent population, increasing Medicaid choice, reducing fraud, authorizing funding of a new charity hospital, and increasing transparency in Medicaid by making performance measures available over the internet. Jindal supported co-payments in Medicaid. Due to a congressional reduction in federal Medicaid financing rates, the Jindal administration chose to levy the largest slice of cuts on the network of LSU charity hospitals and clinics, requiring some facilities to close.",
        "Environmental issues and offshore drilling": "Jindal issued an executive order increasing office recycling programs, reducing solid waste and promoting paperless practices, offering tax credit for hybrid fuel vehicles, increasing average fuel economy goals by 2010, as well as increasing energy efficiency goals and standards for the state. He has stated his opposition to and voted for the criminalization of oil cartels such as OPEC. As a representative in the House, he supported a $300-million bill to fund Louisiana coastal restoration. In addition, he was the chief sponsor of successful legislation to expand the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park by over 3,000 acres (12 km2). Jindal signed bill SB 469 that would limit actions aimed at oil and gas companies operating along the coast.  Jindal pledged state support for the development of economically friendly cars in northeastern Louisiana in conjunction with alternative energy advocate T. Boone Pickens. In September 2014, Jindal stated that global warming was more about increasing government regulation, and released an energy plan that was critical of the Obama Administration's policies.",
        "Earmarks": "In 2007, Jindal led the Louisiana House delegation and ranked 14th among House members in requested earmark funding at nearly $97 million (however in over 99% of these requests, Jindal was a co-sponsor and not the primary initiator of the earmark legislation). $5 million of Jindal's earmark requests were for state defense and indigent healthcare related expenditures, another $50 million was for increasing the safety of Louisiana's waterways and levees after breaches following Hurricane Katrina, and the remainder was targeted towards coastal restoration and alternative energy research. As governor, in 2008, Jindal used his line item veto to strike $16 million in earmarks from the state budget but declined to veto $30 million in legislator-added spending. Jindal vetoed over 250 earmarks in the 2008 state budget, twice the total number of such vetoes by previous governors in the preceding 12 years.",
        "Opposition to Recovery Act": "Jindal has been an opponent of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Citing concerns that the augmentation of unemployment insurance may obligate the state to raise taxes on businesses, Jindal had indicated his intention to forgo federal stimulus plan funds ($98 million) aimed at increasing unemployment insurance for Louisiana. Louisiana has since been obligated to raise taxes on businesses because the unemployment trust fund had dropped below the prescribed threshold. Louisiana was set to receive about $3.8 billion overall. Jindal intended to accept at least $2.4 billion from the stimulus package. He called parts of the plan \"irresponsible\", saying that \"the way to lead is not to raise taxes and put more money and power in hands of Washington politicians.\"",
        "No-go zones": "In 2015, Jindal travelled to the UK to speak out against so-called \"no-go zones\" that were allegedly in London and other western cities. British Prime Minister David Cameron had earlier stated that there were not any no-go zones in the UK. Jindal later confirmed his meaning \"I knew that by speaking the truth we were going to make people upset.\" When later asked by CNN to provide specific examples, Jindal declined. He later added that some Muslim immigrants are trying to \"colonize\" cities in Europe and \"overtake the culture\", and that it could happen next in the U.S.",
        "Personal life": "Jindal was raised in a Hindu household. He is of Indian descent and is a U.S. citizen by birthright. He converted to Christianity while in Baton Rouge Magnet High School.

Nikesh went to Dartmouth College, where he graduated with honors, and then Yale Law School. Nikesh is now a lawyer in Washington, D.C.Jindal's nickname dates to his childhood identification with Bobby Brady, a character from the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. He has been known by his nickname ever since, although his legal name remains Piyush Jindal.In 1997, Jindal married Supriya Jolly, who was born in New Delhi, India while her mother was visiting family there. Her parents lived in Baton Rouge at the time she was born. The two attended the same high school, but Supriya's family moved from Baton Rouge to New Orleans after her freshman year. Supriya Jindal earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering and an M.B.A. degree from Tulane University. She created The Supriya Jindal Foundation for Louisiana's Children, a non-profit organization aimed at improving math and science education in grade schools.They have three children: Selia Elizabeth, Shaan Robert, and Slade Ryan. Shaan was born with a congenital heart defect and had surgery as an infant. The Jindals have been outspoken advocates for children with congenital defects, particularly those without insurance. In 2006, he and his wife delivered their third child at home, with him receiving medical coaching by phone to deliver their boy.Jindal enjoys hunting in Louisiana.As of July 13, 2021, Jindal is the only living former Louisiana Governor following the death of his predecessors: Edwin Edwards (1972-1980; 1984-1988; 1992-1996), Buddy Roemer (1988-1992), Mike Foster (1996-2004) and Kathleen Blanco (2004-2008).",

They include newspaper columns, law review articles, and first authorships in several scientific and policy articles that have appeared in the prominent Journal of the American Medical Association, Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Association, and Hospital Outlook.Jindal's pre-2001 writings include several articles in the New Oxford Review, one of which later made news during his 2003 gubernatorial race. In a 1994 article titled \"Physical Dimensions of Spiritual Warfare\", Jindal described the events leading up to an apparent exorcism of a friend and how he felt unable to help her at the time. However, Jindal questioned whether what he saw was actually an example of \"spiritual warfare\".In November 2010, Jindal published the book Leadership and Crisis, a semi-autobiography significantly influenced by the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill.",

        "Biography": "Andrew Thomas Kearney became part of James O. McKinsey's firm, McKinsey & Company, three years after it was founded in 1926. Kearney was McKinsey's first partner and head of its first office in Chicago. At the time, McKinsey & Company was one of the few firms that were focused on management consulting for top level executives rather than specialized consulting in areas such as accounting or law.\nIn 1937, McKinsey died unexpectedly at the age of 48 due to pneumonia. While the company continued to operate as before, Kearney and the remaining partners disagreed over how to run the firm. This led to a split in the company in 1939, which resulted in Kearney taking the Chicago office and renaming it \"McKinsey, AT Kearney & Company\". In 1947, Kearney sold his rights to the name \"McKinsey\" to Marvin Bower, and renamed his firm AT Kearney & Company. In 1961, Kearney retired and James Phelan became the managing partner of the firm. Kearney died on January 11, 1962.\nAccording to Kearney: \"Our success as consultants will depend upon the essential rightness of the advice we give and our capacity for convincing those in authority that it is good.\""

Kumar is additionally the co-founder of the Indian School of Business with Rajat Gupta and the creator of two different kinds of outsourcing. He graduated from IIT Bombay in India, Imperial College in the UK, and The Wharton School in the US.\nIn 2010 he pleaded guilty to insider trading in a dramatic \"descent from the pinnacle of the business world.\" He was the government's first cooperator and most important witness \"in two of the most important securities fraud trials in history\" against close friends and business partners Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire founder of the Galleon Group family of hedge funds, and Rajat Gupta, the former head of McKinsey and Company and a board member of Goldman Sachs and Procter and Gamble. Rajaratnam and Gupta were both convicted in separate high-profile criminal trials. He was sentenced in 2012 by Judge Denny Chin to two years of probation in exchange for testimony against former friends Rajaratnam and Gupta. Chin stated that \"greed wasn't the motive in [Kumar's] case\" and that \"this was aberrational conduct ... Mr. Kumar has led a law-abiding and productive life.\" Federal prosecutors called Kumar \"one of the best and most important cooperating witnesses\" they had ever worked with.In 2015, an investigation noted that Mr. Kumar had illegally collected funds from insider trading in offshore accounts in the name of his domestic worker, Manju Das. The investigation alleged that Ms. Das had no knowledge of these accounts, which were created with identity documents falsified by Mr. Kumar; and that Mr. Kumar had paid Ms. Das far below minimum wage for several years in violation of US law.",
        "Early life and education": "Kumar graduated first in his class from The Doon School, an elite high school in India, and ranked among the top 100 students across India for admission to the competitive Indian Institute of Technology colleges.

Kumar attended Imperial College at the University of London on \"the equivalent of the Rhodes scholarship\" sponsored by Cecil Rhodes's De Beers Company. He became the first student to complete Imperial's two-year course in applied mechanics in 10 months, and also graduated first in his class. Kumar attended business school at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania with a self-designed major on the management of technology and international business.",
        "Career": "Kumar was a \"star senior partner,\" and \"one of McKinsey\u2019s most senior employees [and] brightest stars.\" He co-founded McKinsey's offices in Silicon Valley and India and created and led the firm's business in three different areas of Internet companies (representing 25-30% of McKinsey's worldwide revenues at its peak), outsourcing, and intrapreneurship. He was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former chief executive Rajat Gupta, though he was blamed for the collapse of McKinsey's e-commerce initiatives after the dot-com collapse and never ran in the elections for managing partner (chief executive). Gupta and Kumar also co-founded the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, India.",
        "McKinsey and Company": "Kumar began his career at Hewlett Packard as a product manager before joining McKinsey and Company in 1986 as one of the earliest Indian-Americans at the consultancy. In 1988 he co-founded McKinsey's offices in Silicon Valley with a partner, growing the office \"from two people to approximately 35\" by 1992. In 1993 as a partner he founded McKinsey's office in New Delhi, which along with the Mumbai office co-founded the consultancy in India. In India he pioneered the concepts of Knowledge Process Outsourcing and Business Process Outsourcing and became the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of then-managing director (chief executive) Rajat Gupta. Kumar returned to the United States to found and lead McKinsey's Internet practice during the dot-com bubble. \"Under [Kumar's] leadership, McKinsey's e-commerce practice grew to represent a full 25-30% of the firm's revenues,\" court documents revealed, though Kumar was blamed for the evaporation of this business in the subsequent dot-com collapse. He and Gupta briefly created a program to allow the firm to accept stock in lieu of consulting fees. Kumar was also Chairman of the Knowledge Center and Chairman of the Asia Center. He was a director and corporate officer of the firm. He lived and worked from multiple offices in New Delhi, New York, and Silicon Valley, traveling over thirty thousand miles a month.He was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Young Presidents' Organization, a founding charter member of TiE, and was the United States chairman of India's largest business lobby, the Confederation of Indian Industry.Criticism of Kumar centered around his close relationship with Gupta and a perception of arrogance. According to The Financial Times, \"the two operated as a forceful double-act to secure business for McKinsey, win access in Washington and build a brotherhood of donors around the Hyderabad-based ISB and a handful of social initiatives.\" Also according to the Times, \"as much as Mr Kumar was admired for his business ability and sharpness, he also drew fire for what was seen as his arrogance.\"",
        "Galleon investigation": "Kumar maintained an intentionally low profile outside McKinsey until an October 2009 arrest in conjunction with an ongoing and wide-ranging US governmental investigation into insider trading. Former mentor Rajat Gupta was later arrested by the FBI in a related case, prompting inquiries into McKinsey's senior leadership and business model.As of December 2009, Kumar was no longer at the consultancy. In January 2010 he pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and was \"the government\u2019s star witness\" in March 2011 against billionaire friend and Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam (United States v. Rajaratnam). In the sprawling case his involvement was unusual; according to a Reuters blog, \"He\u2019s the only informant who could be considered even more successful than Raj was, at least professionally if not in terms of raw cash. Raj had money, more money than he really knew what to do with, but Kumar had much more societal acceptance and prestige.\" He settled with the SEC in May 2010 for $2.8 million, the amount after gains he received from Rajaratnam through a Swiss bank account in a domestic worker's name. Gupta, Rajaratnam, and Kumar were all close friends and had founded the $1.3-billion private equity firm New Silk Route together, though Rajaratnam and Kumar withdrew before the firm began operation.Kumar was represented by the late Robert Morvillo, who had previously led billionaire Martha Stewart\u2019s defense in her own insider trading case.He testified again as \"the Government's key witness\" in the May 2012 criminal trial of former mentor Rajat Gupta (United States v. Gupta), where he described the relationships between Gupta, Rajaratnam and himself. To do so was difficult, according to federal prosecutors, \"because [Kumar] knew that he could be partially responsible for helping to convict someone with whom he and his family had deep and long-lasting ties.\" Bloomberg commented, \"When business guru Rajat Gupta and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Anil Kumar, worked together to expand management consultancy McKinsey & Co in the 1990s, a date in court years later surely was not part of the plan.\"Both Rajaratnam and Gupta were ultimately convicted in separate high-profile criminal trials.\nInternational media, business, and finance industry observers have analyzed extensively Kumar's actions in aiding Rajaratnam. Consensus remains divided on the precise motivators of money, respect, and relationship, with The New York Times asking, \"Why would people who seem to have it all \u2014 wealth, prestige, powerful jobs and infinite access to others with the same \u2014 risk that, and more, to provide inside information to the Sri Lankan-born billionaire?\". Rajaratnam's annual payments were estimated at less than 5% of Kumar's annual income (and just 1-2% excluding a one-time bonus), further raising the question of motivation. Prosecutors wondered \"why an incredibly bright, highly accomplished, professional consultant, and senior partner at arguably the world\u2019s leading consulting firm, who contributed considerable time to start the Indian School of Business and to other charities, would betray his profession\u2019s core values.\" One media source questioned Kumar's sentencing report. Judge Chin would ultimately rule that \"greed wasn't the motive in [Kumar's] case.\"Federal prosecutors said \"Kumar's testimony was nothing short of devastating. Kumar was credible, precise, and fully corroborated.\" In July 2012 he was sentenced by Judge Denny Chin to two years of probation, ending in July 2014.",
        "Education and non-profits": "Kumar co-founded the Indian School of Business with Gupta in 1997, today ranked among the top 15 business schools in the world by The Financial Times. Court documents revealed he personally raised approximately 35% of all money donated to the school and kept a low profile as co-founder: \"a large part of the intellectual vision of ISB is in fact Anil's, a point not many outside ISB's leadership will ever be aware of.\"In New Delhi, Kumar helped IIT Delhi double its student body with no increase in costs and was a founding board member of the Bharti Foundation. In San Jose, he served on the boards of the Children's Discovery Museum and San Jose Civic Light Opera.\nAs of 2012, he was working with the Baylor College of Medicine and Max Healthcare to start a medical university, teaching hospital, and nursing school in India, and also with the Hero Group to start an 8000-person engineering college in India.",
        "Personal life": "Kumar maintained an intentionally low public profile, and according to prosecutors was \"earning significant amounts of money at McKinsey [though] lived relatively modestly, his assets far exceeded his liabilities.\" He lived and worked for decades in New Delhi, New York, and Silicon Valley, traveling over thirty thousand miles a month for McKinsey. He had a Manhattan apartment in the Time Warner Center and a house in Saratoga, California. He is married and has one son.",

        "Survivor": "No information",
        "Cook Islands": "In 2006, Kwon was recruited to participate in the thirteenth season of Survivor, which took place in the Cook Islands. This season was notable for the producers' decision to divide the contestants into tribes by their ethnicity, a decision that generated substantial controversy. When asked why he agreed to go on the show, he cited his desire to provide a positive role model for his community, and the lack of representation by Asian Americans on television.Originally on the Asian American Puka Puka tribe, Kwon led his tribe to dominate in the first two tribal immunity challenges, while winning rewards on both occasions. On Puka Puka, Kwon developed a long-lasting alliance and friendship with fellow Korean-American attorney Rebekah \"Becky\" Lee. In Episode 2, Kwon was banished to Exile Island by the Hispanic Aitutaki tribe, after Aitutaki intentionally lost the second immunity challenge. On Exile Island, Kwon was able to decipher the clues and find the hidden immunity idol, which would be very instrumental to his survival later in the game.In Episode Three, the four ethnically-divided tribes integrated into two tribes, and both Kwon and Lee became members of the new Aitutaki tribe. Kwon and Lee immediately developed a four-person alliance with Jonathan Penner and Candice Woodcock of the old white Rarotonga tribe. When Aitutaki lost the next immunity challenge and the opposing new Rarotonga tribe sent Candice to Exile Island, Yul's alliance became outnumbered and Lee became a target. However, Kwon and Penner were able to convince Anh-Tuan \"Cao Boi\" Bui and Jessica \"Flicka\" Smith from their old respective tribes to side with them and voted out Cecilia Mansilla. After that, the new Aitutaki tribe enjoyed back-to-back immunity challenge wins in episodes 4 and 5.In Episode Six, both tribes were informed they would have to vote someone out of their tribe, regardless of the challenge results. Despite being from the same original tribe, Kwon and his alliance voted out Cao Boi, seeing him as a loose cannon that could not to be trusted. It was around this point that Kwon, Lee, Penner and Woodcock recruited Sundra Oakley to their now 5-person alliance. In Episode 7, this new alliance targeted Oscar \"Ozzy\" Lusth due to his strength in challenges. But when the Aitutaki tribe lost immunity, they voted out Flicka, admitting they needed Ozzy for future challenges. Both tribes were now tied at 6 members each.In Episode Eight, all remaining survivors were given the chance to \"mutiny\" and defect to the opposite tribe. Woodcock, who saw this as an opportunity to get back to her old Rarotonga tribemates and friends, Adam Gentry and Parvati Shallow, mutinied to the Rarotonga tribe, and Penner would subsequently follow Woodcock. The mutiny left Kwon, Lee, Oakley and Lusth as a tribe of four against a tribe of eight, and were dubbed as the \"Aitu 4\" as such. Despite these odds, the new Aitu 4 were able to dominate in the challenges and win four challenges in a row, sending Rarotonga to tribal council where they voted out Brad Virata, Rebecca Borman and (in a twist where they had to vote out two members in one tribal council) Jenny Guzon-Bae. These three survivors became members of the jury.At the Final Nine, the two tribes (Aitutaki and Rarotonga) merged into Aitutonga. The Aitu 4 were still outnumbered by the five Rarotonga members. However, Kwon devised a plan to use the Hidden Immunity Idol to blackmail former ally and mutineer Penner. By using his Hidden Immunity Idol to threaten to eliminate Penner at Tribal Council, Penner decided to defect from Rarotonga and join the Aitu 4 to save himself. The Aitu 4 and Penner surprised Rarotonga at Tribal Council and voted out Nathan \"Nate\" Gonzalez. In the Survivor Auction at the Final 8, Kwon revealed to the remaining Rarotonga members and the host Jeff Probst that he held the Hidden Immunity Idol. The Aitu 4 and Penner continued to control the game and voted out their former ally and mutineer Woodcock.\nAt the Final Seven, Kwon, then dubbed the \"Ringleader\", \"Puppet Master\" and \"Godfather\", was constantly being pressured by the remaining Rarotonga members to vote out the traitor Penner. Knowing that their days in the game were numbered, Gentry and Shallow both threatened to vote against Kwon in the jury if Kwon refused to vote out Penner before them. Kwon made a deal with Gentry that if Penner was voted out ahead of him and Shallow, he would gain Gentry's vote in the jury, and Penner was voted out. In the next two Tribal Councils, Shallow and Gentry were voted out respectively, propelling the Aitu 4 into the final 4.Once in the Final Four, Lee, Lusth, Oakley, and Kwon were shocked to hear that instead of a standard Final Two, the final tribal council would consist of three members. At the immunity challenge, Lusth continued to dominate, winning his spot in the Final Three. Kwon, still protected by the hidden immunity idol, was also safe. Both Lusth and Kwon agreed that the fairest decision would be a tie-breaker challenge between Lee and Oakley. Kwon offered his idol to Lee, but she declined. In the tie-breaker, neither Lee nor Oakley could start a fire with flint within a one-hour limit. Moving to matches, both still had trouble, and Oakley ran out of matches. Lee went on to win the challenge, moving her into the Final Three with Lusth and Kwon.\nIn the Final Tribal Council, Kwon was credited for his strategic prowess and his ability in the social aspect of the game, whereas Lusth was credited for his domination in the physical aspect of the game. In the end, Kwon beat out Ozzy Lusth and Becky Lee in a 5-4-0 vote to become the Sole Survivor, gaining the votes of Brad Virata, Candice Woodcock, Jonathan Penner, Adam Gentry, and Sundra Oakley.",
        "Winners at War": "Kwon returned to the game on Survivor: Winners at War after a 14-year and 27-season hiatus. He was originally a member of the Dakal tribe where he aligned himself with Sophie Clarke, Nick Wilson, and Wendell Holland. The four of them began targeting old-school players. Kwon then became a part of the Sele tribe following a tribal swap. He had a hand in voting off Amber Mariano, Tyson Apostol, and Parvati Shallow during the first three tribal councils he attended, but he later became the ninth person voted off and placed 14th on day 35 after not earning the right to return to the game from the Edge of Extinction. As a juror, Kwon cast his vote for eventual winner Tony Vlachos.",

At the time, he was one of only two one-time contestants to appear in the top 10, the other being Tony Vlachos of Survivor: Cagayan (who has since played again on Survivor: Game Changers and Survivor: Winners at War alongside Kwon). In a 2015 interview shortly before the premiere of the 30th season, host Jeff Probst declared Kwon to be one of his top 10 favorite Survivor winners ever, and one of his top 6 favorite male winners.Kwon made several notable lists in 2006/2007, including People Magazine's Sexiest Men Alive, People Magazine's Hottest Bachelors, and Extra TV's Most Eligible Bachelors. He was profiled in VIBE Magazine's \"Juice\" issue as part of the New Power Generation, consisting of people who will shape the future.

In 2017, the magazine also had fans rank the 34 winners of Survivor and Kwon was ranked 9th.In 2007, Kwon worked as a special correspondent for CNN on a series exploring issues affecting the Asian American community. The series, Uncovering America, aired on CNN's American Morning. The topics Kwon examined included the portrayal of Asian Americans in the media, the glass ceiling in the corporate workplace, and affirmative action. He was also interviewed regarding these issues on Anderson Cooper 360. In July 2022, Kwon competed on the USA Network's reality competition series, Snake in the Grass.",
        "Personal life": "Kwon proposed to his girlfriend, Sophie Tan, in April 2008. The couple had been set up by one of Kwon's Survivor tribemates, Brad Virata.

Leppert told graduates to \"know your principles\" and encouraged them to write them down. \"This may sound simple and obvious, but over the course of a lifetime, it may be one of the most difficult promises you ever keep. I know I am confronted by this each and every day. Simply stated, using generic terms like honesty and integrity are not near enough[...] People rarely get in trouble or lose their compass in one fell swoop... it is a series of small compromises, missteps that lead to a landslide... and a lost sense of self.\" In the same speech, Leppert called his visit to Auschwitz a \"single day [that] changed the way I looked at the world.\"\nLeppert is a member of First Baptist Church Dallas and was formerly a member of the Dallas Country Club (prior to resigning in December 2006 due to his concern that the club's tradition of refusing membership to black applicants could become an issue during the mayoral campaign).

        "Mayor of Dallas": "Leppert defeated city councilman Ed Oakley in a runoff election June 16, 2007, winning with 58 percent of the vote. Some attribute his win to unexpected support from leaders within the African American community of the traditionally Democratic southern section of the city and his appeal to Republicans.While the office of mayor is officially non-partisan, like all municipal offices in Texas, Leppert is a Republican who participates in party fundraising events.After his first year in office, Leppert's runoff election opponent (Oakley) praised him for his leadership and for delivering on his campaign promises:  \"There's no question: Tom's done an excellent job. He's delivered on his priorities.\"  Shortly before Leppert's resignation, however, Oakley had second thoughts and publicly wondered whether Leppert was more interested in his own advancement than the city's.",
        "Political positions and actions": "In his inaugural address, Leppert stated that his first order of business would be to \"reach out to everybody [and] include everybody from everywhere\" and he emphasized a need to change the City Council's tone, stating: \"rather than punishing business, City Hall needs to start promoting business.\"  As he did during the mayoral campaign, Leppert made education a theme of his inaugural address, proclaiming:  \"when a big issue like underperforming schools is holding back an entire city and hindering our growth, then it is everyone's problem.\"  With respect to crime, he said the council must use two objectives by which to judge its crime-fighting performance: lowering Dallas' typically high crime-rate ranking among the nation's largest cities, and building confidence and trust in all Dallas neighborhoods for police and fire personnel.  Finally, he firmly restated his commitment to enact the Trinity River Corridor plan, calling the project \"a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and it will be the catalyst that puts Dallas on the world stage, if we seize the moment and get it done.\"Two years into his term, Leppert had won support from a core coalition of Dallas City Council members (Dwaine Caraway, Dave Neumann, and Ron Natinsky), who voted with Leppert more than 92 percent of the time, a rate roughly equal to his record of being on the winning side of council roll call votes.  Indeed, Caraway even went so far as to declare that he \"would take a bullet\" for the Mayor during a heated debate over the Trinity River Project.Leppert donated his mayoral salary to a scholarship fund for students from low-income families.In his campaign for Texas Senator in 2012, Leppert ran ads that characterized his opponents as \"empty suits\".",
        "Crime reduction": "Leppert ran on the pledge of reducing crime and increasing the number of police officers in the city of Dallas. He helped add 200 new police officers to the city's ranks, which coincided with a drop in crime rates each year Leppert was in office\u2014including a 10% reduction in 2010.",
        "Economic development and jobs": "In January 2008, Mayor Leppert embarked on a trade mission to Monterrey, Mexico, to promote Dallas's medical, educational, and corporate institutions. Another part of the trip's agenda was to lobby on behalf of an inland seaport in the Dallas area. Leppert was joined by more than a dozen officials from city government, the Dallas Independent School District and various health care and commercial institutions in the largest mission of its kind in years. One of the agreements reached on the trip include a plan for an MD/PhD program in Mexico provided by UT Southwestern Medical School. Leppert also stated that Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n would be visiting Dallas on his next visit to the United States.\nFollowing his trip to Mexico, Leppert led a trade mission to China and signed \"friendship city\" agreements with major industrial cities such as Dalian and Qingdao. Leppert also oversaw the negotiation of business deals with Chinese officials, such as advocacy of investment in the Dallas Inland Port and the placement of a Chinese telecommunication firm's U.S. headquarters in Dallas.Leppert is also credited with persuading AT&T to relocate to Dallas as well as encouraging the start-up of a new $15 million call center that plans to ultimately employ 300 workers.",
        "Convention center hotel": "In December 2008, Leppert began lobbying the Obama administration for $386 million in Community Development Block Grant funds to be awarded by the federal government for the purpose of building a new convention center hotel in downtown Dallas (a project that had been on Dallas' drawing board for nearly two decades), stating: \"Let's use this as an opportunity.  Most of the economy in the country is in metro areas. Let's make sure we use this (stimulus) money much as we did back in the 1930s, so that when we come out we have a much stronger economy and we're in a much better position.\"Following the federal government's failure to approve Leppert's request for stimulus funds, in February 2009 he announced plans to seek an alternate form of financing. He argued that if Dallas did not build the hotel, it would fall further behind other cities in the competition for convention and tourism business, and that larger conventions would not even consider Dallas because it does not have a hotel attached to its convention center. He also argued that, because it would attract more visitors to Dallas, the building of the hotel would lead to a broadening of Dallas' tax base and an increase in jobs and sales tax revenue to the city. In May 2009, he successfully lobbied the City Council to approve spending $42 million to purchase land on which the proposed hotel would be located.The project was financed with $388.2 million in federally-subsidized revenue bonds issued under the Obama administration's Build America Bonds program (which means that the federal government reimburses the city 35% of the interest associated with the issue) and $91.7 million in conventional hotel revenue bonds ($479.9 million total).  Repayment is anticipated to come from a combination of $249.1 million in direct subsidies from the federal government (associated with the Build America Bonds), $212.9 million in pledged state and city occupancy and sales taxes associated with the property's operation, and the remainder from hotel net operating income. In addition, the bonds are further backed by a \"Moral Obligation Pledge\" from the City of Dallas to cover any shortfalls. The hotel broke ground in 2009 and is projected to open in 2012.In an effort to reinforce the success of the hotel, Leppert led the City Council to lobby Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) to change the alignment of a proposed light rail line through downtown; under Leppert's plan, the line would be diverted from the center of downtown to stop at the hotel and would include a subway segment that would travel beneath the convention center to an underground station at City Hall before rejoining the original alignment.  DART staff, however, reported that, at $824 million, the proposed realignment would be more expensive than all other options being considered, exceeding the cost of the cheapest alignment by $315 million.  They also pointed out that the Federal Transit Administration makes the final call on where the route should go, and the hotel alignment had been shown to attract fewer riders, at higher costs, than other options.  Nevertheless, Leppert continued to serve as a strong advocate for the realignment, stating:  \"The hotel alignment serves downtown's transportation needs and supports the public and private investment in our city's core.\"",
        "Education": "On February 21, 2008, Leppert unveiled The Every Child Ready to Read @ Dallas program. This program was part of Leppert's larger plan to improve Dallas's education system which was unveiled in 2007.",
        "Ethics and open government": "In December 2007, Leppert released his ethics plan that would ban city council members from accepting free tickets to events, and modernize the city's campaign finance disclosure system by creating a searchable, online campaign finance database and requiring electronic filing of campaign finance reports for political candidates in the city. In March 2008, the city council approved Leppert's electronic campaign finance filing system proposal.In November 2009, the city council passed a series of four ethics reforms championed by Leppert that:\nRequired lobbyists to register with the city\nLimited campaign contributions from developers\nRequired disclosure of gifts to council members over $50\nRequired two city council members to \"second\" major zoning cases and certify they have reviewed the details of the zoning case before the matter can be voted on",
        "Love Field no-bid concessions contract extensions": "Leppert ignited a controversy when he opposed no-bid concessions contract extensions with current Love Field food vendor Star Concessions Ltd. and newspaper and book vendor Hudson Retail Dallas during a March 3, 2010, city council meeting. Leppert insisted that the contracts should be opened to public bidding instead. Leppert demanded that city staff\u2014who backed the extensions\u2014appear before the full council and explain why the concessions contracts were not opened to public bidding.On February 22, 2010, the city council's Transportation and Environment Committee had previously voted to extend contracts with the existing concessions for through 2026 with an additional 3-year option and exclusive rights to 54 percent of vending space in a new terminal scheduled to open in 2014, instead of opening the contract up to public biddingIn an April 26, 2010, editorial, The Dallas Morning News called the lack of transparency and fiduciary responsibility \"troubling\". The Dallas Morning News noted that the situation was complicated by the fact that the concessions operators were partially owned by two elected officials\u2014State Representative Helen Giddings and U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson.On May 21, 2010, The Dallas Morning News reported that Assistant City Manager A.C. Gonzalez said that city staff recommended in June 2007 that all concession space in the renovated airport be opened up for competitive bids, but that plan was opposed by city council members. On June 9, 2010, The Dallas Morning News reported that airport consultants said that the no-bid plan was unusual and could result in an inferior deal for the city. According to a June 17, 2010 article in the Dallas Observer, Gilbert Aranza\u2014owner of Star Concessions Ltd.\u2014accused Leppert of hypocrisy given his support for similar no-bid contract extensions during his tenure on the D/FW Airport Board.In an apparent victory for Leppert, the city council voted on August 18, 2010, to open all concessions space in the new terminal for public bidding; city staff would attempt to reach a deal with Star and Hudson to operate existing concessions space from 2011 to 2014, otherwise it would also be opened for public bidding.",
        "Property tax rate increases": "During candidate Leppert's 2007 mayoral campaign, he ran a television commercial featuring Dallas Cowboys legend Roger Staubach telling Dallasites, \"I hope you'll say 'no' to new taxes by saying 'yes' to Tom Leppert.\" However, in September of that year he voted with the majority of the Dallas City Council in a successful push to raise taxes, hailing the budget as a good deal for Dallas residents, balancing a modest tax increase against a bevy of improved city services.In subsequent years, however, Leppert opposed property tax rate increases in the city of Dallas and proposed spending cuts to balance the budget.In 2008, despite early calls for another property tax rate increase, Leppert successfully led opposition to prevent another rate increase. Leppert also successfully led opposition to another proposal to increase property tax rates in 2009.In 2010, once again, Leppert led the opposition of yet another property tax rate increase proposal. In response to the estimated $130 million shortfall in the city's $2 billion budget, Leppert crafted a new budget proposal to close the budget gap without increasing taxes. Despite Leppert's strong objections, the city council voted by an 8-7 majority to pass a 6.5% property tax rate increase anyway\u2014the largest in 20 years.",
        "Electoral history": "After receiving a plurality of votes among a crowded field of candidates in the 2007 Dallas Mayoral Election, Leppert won a spot in a runoff election along with Dallas City Council member Ed Oakley. Leppert was victorious in the runoff election.",
        "Political future": "In late 2008, it was widely rumored that Leppert would run in a potential special election for Kay Bailey Hutchison's United States Senate seat, which she was widely expected to vacate during her run for Texas governor; in a December newspaper interview, Leppert denied he had started to campaign, but he refused to entirely rule out the possibility. However, Hutchison retained her Senate seat, and her gubernatorial campaign ended when she lost the 2010 Texas Republican primary to incumbent Rick Perry.\nRumors soon circulated that Leppert was considering a Senate run directly against Hutchison in 2012, a possibility he did not refute during an April 2010, interview.In January 2011, Leppert announced that he would not seek re-election to the office of mayor in May. This further fueled speculation that he was planning a run for the now open U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Hutchison.\nOn February 22, 2011, it was reported that Leppert would announce his resignation from the office of mayor the next day. The Washington Post noted that this is a necessary first step for his expected run for Senate because Dallas law prohibits the mayor from running for another office while still serving as mayor.Leppert resigned his seat as mayor effective at midnight on February 25, 2011. He told The Dallas Morning News that his campaign for the U.S. Senate would begin immediately, with Mike Slanker, former political director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, acting as his chief campaign consultant.\nLeppert was eliminated from the U.S. Senate race after finishing third in the May 29, 2012 Republican primary election, earning 13.3% of the votes cast. Former Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz eventually won the 2012 Republican nomination for the open Senate seat, defeating Lt. Governor David Dewhurst in the Republican primary runoff by 57% to 43% on July 31, 2012.During a campaign rally in Fort Worth, Leppert endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican Presidential Primary."

    "Jeremy Liew": {
        "Introduction": "Jeremy Liew (born 21 September 1971) is a venture capitalist, best known for making the initial seed investment in Snapchat.",
        "Early life and education": "Liew was born in Singapore and raised in Perth, Western Australia, where his parents still reside.  In his senior year in high school, he represented Australia at the International Math Olympiad, where his teammate was future Fields Medalist Terry Tao.He graduated from Australian National University with majors in linguistics and mathematics. Following graduation, he joined McKinsey as a business analyst, first working in Sydney and then briefly in Johannesburg. When one of his bosses started CitySearch, a mid-90s Internet pioneer, he moved to Los Angeles to join the company, working in sales and as manager of strategic planning.In 1998, Liew went back to school, receiving an MBA from Stanford University in 2000. After graduation, he became vice president of strategic planning for USA Networks. He was involved in the transition to IAC, when it added companies such as Ticketmaster, Expedia and Hotel.com to its portfolio. He spent three years at AOL/Netscape as a corporate strategy executive and then entered the world of venture capital.",
        "Venture capital": "In 2006, he joined venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners as its first consumer specialist partner. At that time, Lightspeed it was a small firm specializing in tech startups that were largely unknown outside of Silicon Valley. He noticed that startups that were used predominantly by young women were the most successful. He concluded that young women were the most likely carriers of the next popular cultural trend. To better understand this demographic, he looked outside of Silicon Valley to Los Angeles and New York to observe their consumer preferences, and develop a data driven approach to it.In 2015, he noted that most of the boards he was on at the time were outside of Silicon Valley. This \"follow the woman\" thesis eventually led him to Snapchat, when in 2012 a partner told him that his daughter and her friends were obsessed with a new app he should look into. This led to a meeting with co-founder Evan Spiegel. He subsequently became the first  investor in Snapchat.The initial investment was $485,000, but in following rounds of investments, Lightspeed invested a total of $8.1 million into the app. This increased 250-fold in value to just under $2 billion at the time of Snapchat's IPO in 2017. Relations between Spiegel and Liew quickly deteriorated, as Spiegel felt he was taken advantage of with an onerous agreement for the initial seeding. This was later modified giving Lightspeed further shares at a discount. \nLiew was the first and last investor to get special terms from the company. The success Liew brought Lightspeed with this investment and its IPO put the firm, having become a megafund, into the elite of the competitive V.C. world. The return on the IPO was greater than what the firm had raised in 2006. Liew was described as a major winner in all of this.",
        "Investments": "Liew was the first institutional investor and early member of the board of Bonobos, an upscale, e-commerce-driven apparel company that is now a subsidiary of Walmart. He was also a first investor and member of the board of Jessica Alba's firm, The Honest Company. He became a board member of Affirm, a financial lender of installment loans for consumers, after becoming the co-first institutional investor.Jeremy Liew has been a featured speaker and moderator at conferences on video game monetization and has been called a \"social game visionary.\"  He has invested in a number of successful gaming companies, including Playdom (acquired by Disney), Serious Business (bought by Zynga), Kixeye, and Fan Controlled Football. He feels that user engagement is more important than design and is skeptical of Facebook games, referring to them as \"highly deterministic and predictable.\"He was an active investor in media and entertainment, with startups including Giphy (sold to Facebook), HQ, Cheddar Inc., and Beme (acquired by CNN). Successful exits have included Flixster (acquired by Warner Brothers), Kongregate (acquired by GameStop and later by Modern Times), and Slice (acquired by Rakuten). Recognizing that consumer trends begin with women and are best spread by word-of-mouth led Liew (who heard about it that way) to make a $7 million investment in Rothy's, a company making shoes from recycled plastic bottles and are recyclable themselves.Liew was also involved in investments that turned out to be disappointing, including Zest AI (formerly ZestFinance), which started out as an online platform to consumers for point-of-sale subprime financing, using Artificial Intelligence to screen for suitable borrowers, now selling software. He invested in Living Social, which was a daily deals firm that enjoyed a meteoric rise, but ultimately failed. In 2016, it was acquired by Groupon for $0. Liew had invested in the first ridesharing company, named Sidecar. The startup lost out to Uber and Lyft, folding in 2015. Finally, another investment of his, Mic, a media and internet company catering to millennials, saw its value dwindle from hundreds of millions of dollars in 2017 to $5 million in November 2018, the value at which it was sold to Bustle. Liew ascribed the collapse to a change in Facebook algorithms.",

He worked for the St. Louis Cardinals in their scouting department from 2003 through 2011, before joining the Astros in December 2011. On January 13, 2020, Luhnow was fired by the Astros after Major League Baseball suspended him for the entire 2020 season as a result of the electronic sign-stealing scandal. Prior to working in baseball, Luhnow was a business entrepreneur.",
        "Early life and education": "Luhnow was born in Mexico City, Mexico, and raised in the Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhood. He is fluent in Spanish. Prior to his birth, his parents had relocated from New York City to Mexico City for business. Luhnow attended schools in Mexico City through 10th grade and a preparatory high school in California for his 11th and 12th-grade years.He graduated from the Webb School of California and holds dual Bachelor of Science degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in economics and engineering. He earned an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.",
        "Business career": "Prior to baseball, Luhnow worked as an engineer, management consultant, and technology entrepreneur. He worked for McKinsey and Company, a global management consulting firm, for five years. He founded and served as president and chief operating officer of Archetype Solutions, and served as general manager and vice president of marketing for Petstore.com.",
        "Baseball career": "No information",
        "St. Louis Cardinals": "Luhnow joined the front office of the St. Louis Cardinals in 2003. Cardinals owner William DeWitt Jr. had noticed what the Oakland A's had done with their Moneyball tactics and was looking to run his team in a more analytical, data-driven manner when he first hired Luhnow as vice president in 2003. Luhnow knew DeWitt's son-in-law from working at McKinsey & Company and from there, Luhnow met DeWitt and landed the job. Luhnow's hiring initially prompted skepticism, since he had no previous experience in baseball and had not played the sport since high school. He was derided with nicknames like \"the accountant\" and \"Harry Potter.\"Luhnow began as the Cardinals' vice president of baseball development, as he established a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic and extended the Cardinals' scouting in Venezuela. The Cardinals promoted him in 2005 to the role of vice president of player procurement, which made him the director of amateur, international and domestic scouting. He was named vice president of scouting and player development in 2006.During his time with the Cardinals, he developed a reputation for scouting and player development, and he was credited with having a key role in the team's successes in the minor leagues. The Cardinals won five minor league championships under his watch, and had the best system-wide minor league record in 2010. From 2005 to 2007, the first three Cardinals drafts overseen by Luhnow produced 24 future major leaguers, the most of any team during that period. Several players who made important contributions to the Cardinals' victory in the 2011 World Series, including Jaime Garcia, Allen Craig, Jon Jay, and Lance Lynn, were drafted during Luhnow's tenure.",
        "Houston Astros": "The Houston Astros announced Luhnow's hiring as the team's general manager on December 8, 2011, replacing Ed Wade. In making the announcement, team president George Postolos cited Luhnow's past successes in player development and scouting with the Cardinals organization. He also expressed hope that \"[Luhnow's] bicultural background [would] be an asset in recruiting players from Latin America and developing the Hispanic market for Los Astros.\" Luhnow \"was so devoted to efficiency that he engaged consultants from McKinsey to audit the organization (and, inevitably, to disrupt the org chart) every year\".After Luhnow's first season, he opted to fire Astros' manager Brad Mills, replacing him with Bo Porter after the 2012 season. Porter was forced to keep most of Mills' coaching staff, with third base coach Dave Trembley and hitting coach John Mallee serving as Porter's only additions to the staff for the 2013 season. Luhnow and Porter had a falling out during the 2014 season, leading Luhnow to fire Porter. He chose A. J. Hinch as Porter's successor, and allowed Hinch to choose his coaching staff, with the exception of Brent Strom, the pitching coach, whom the team chose to retain. Luhnow received a contract extension at an undisclosed time in 2014.News of an investigation into potential Cardinals front office personnel hacking into the Astros' baseball operations databases seeking information on player development, evaluation, and compensation broke on June 16, 2015. According to the Los Angeles Times, \"MLB issued a statement saying it has cooperated with the investigation but would take no action until 'the investigative process has been completed by federal law enforcement officials.'\"On January 13, 2020, Luhnow and Hinch were suspended for the 2020 season by Rob Manfred, the Commissioner of Baseball, for failing to prevent the Astros from cheating by electronically stealing signs during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. According to Manfred, Luhnow adamantly denied knowing about Astros players banging on a trash can to signal specific pitches, or that employees in the replay room were decoding signs and sending them to the dugout. Manfred stated that while Luhnow didn't know about players' efforts to use technology to steal signs, he should have made it his business to know, given that the general manager is charged with ensuring that the baseball side of a franchise's operations complies with \"both standards set by Club ownership and MLB Rules.\" If Luhnow commits another \"material violation\" of MLB rules, he will be permanently banned from baseball. Manfred also required Luhnow to undergo \"management/leadership training\" during his suspension. It is the longest suspension for a baseball executive since former Atlanta Braves general manager John Coppolella was banned from baseball for life in 2017.\nAccording to Manfred, had Luhnow taken \"adequate steps\" to ensure the Astros followed the rules, the sign stealing operation could have been shut down as early as Manfred's September 2017 memo reminding all clubs that it was illegal to use electronic equipment to steal signs, and certainly by March 2018, when MLB disciplinarian Joe Torre issued a memo which clarified the ban on using technology to steal signs. As a result of that failure, Manfred decided to hold Luhnow \"personally responsible for the conduct of his Club.\" He also harshly criticized the culture of the Astros' baseball operations department, saying that its emphasis on \"results over other considerations\" fostered an environment that not only made it possible for the sign stealing to continue for as long as it did, but also allowed Luhnow's assistant, Brandon Taubman, to make inappropriate and sexist remarks to female reporters after the Astros clinched the 2019 pennant. Taubman was fired for lying about the comments, and was subsequently placed on the ineligible list through at least the 2020 season. Manfred later claimed that Luhnow's failure to notify the players about the 2017 memo was a major reason why MLB didn't discipline any players for their roles in the scandal. Manfred told ESPN that had he suspended or fined any players for their roles, the MLB Players Association would have challenged such discipline \"on the basis that we never properly informed them of the rules.\"Hours after MLB announced its sanctions, Astros owner Jim Crane fired Luhnow and Hinch. Crane said, \"Neither of them started this but neither of them did anything about it.",

        "Canc\u00fan F.C.": "In May 2021, Luhnow had shown interest in acquiring a Mexican soccer team, during which time he was part of a group that negotiated the purchase of Atl\u00e9tico San Luis, although the purchase agreement did not materialize. Subsequently, in January 2022, Jeff Luhnow headed an investment fund that completed the purchase of the Mexican team Canc\u00fan F.C. that participates in the Liga de Expansi\u00f3n MX.

        "Dog-barbecuing incident": "In August 1959, Malek and four other men were arrested in Vicary's Park near Peoria, Illinois after a dog was killed, eviscerated and barbecued on a spit. Charges of cruelty to animals were later dismissed against all but one of the men, Andrew P. O'Meara, who testified that he alone had struck and killed the dog, skinned it and tried to cook it, in order to teach the others something about living off the land.The story came up again when Malek became an advisor and fundraiser to Sarah Palin in the 2008 presidential campaign. Amid accusations that Malek himself had killed and barbecued the dog, Malek, in his blog, quoted O'Meara, a retired Army colonel, taking \"full responsibility\" for what happened.During the 2012 presidential campaign the incident once again came up when Malek's hosting of Ann Romney's birthday party was brought up by the semi-satirical group Dogs Against Romney.",

On May 18, 2007, Thayer was found in negligence of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and was ultimately forced to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, while Malek personally paid a fine of $100,000 for his role in the affair.It was alleged that Malek acted to enrich himself as well as advance his own political and financial interests, in addition to the benefit the fraudulent scheme would bring to him as a significant partner in Thayer. Former Connecticut State Senator and Representative DiBella testified under oath in federal court that his relationship with Malek went beyond the latters official position at Thayer, he testified that his contract obligated him to assist Malek personally with \"ongoing investor relations.\u201d and that Malek personally told him \"I need you for the new treasurer\u201d (the new treasurer being the incoming Denise Nappier). The scheme moved much of the Connecticut State Retirement and Trust Fund into high-risk, long term, non-liquid private equity funds (such as Thayer's).

R. Haldeman to identify a list of Democrats and \"important Jewish officials\" at the agency. Malek provided the data on Democrats after a check of voter registration rolls, but balked at fulfilling the rest of Nixon's query. \"I refused four times. The fifth time he came back and gave me a direct order through Haldeman, so I gave him a number. I regret my compliance. It was a mistake.\" Malek did not have access to BLS employees' religious affiliations, so his list comprised those BLS employees with \"Jewish-sounding names\", and two months after he sent the list, two of the officials on it were reassigned to \"less visible jobs\" within the Labor Dept.Seymour D. Reich, chairman of Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations during the 1990s, said \"Malek made a mistake 18 years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by President Nixon.\" But he added, Malek \"has taken pains to assure the Jewish community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm. I believe he is sincere.\" In 2010, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Ca.) called Malek \"a man of high principle\" who \"has proved many times over the years his loyalty to the highest principles of freedom, human rights and international tolerance.\" On December 15, 2014, Malek received the Anti Defamation League's Achievement award during a ceremony in Washington, D.C.",

Malek, who was a special assistant to Mr. Nixon, emphatically denied that he had engaged in an anti-Semitic act.In September 1989, Malek was appointed by President Bush to coordinate plans for the 1990 economic summit of industrialized nations. The appointment was seen as a test of whether Malek could successfully serve in the administration.

        "Delaware governor": "No information",
        "Elections": "No information",
        "2008": "On June 6, 2007, Markell officially launched his candidacy for governor of Delaware, setting up a primary with lieutenant governor John Carney. Beginning in the summer of 2007, Markell released fourteen policy papers on issues ranging from energy to health care to education. Early, Markell was far behind in polls and endorsements; the Young Democrats Movement and other organizations allowed Markell to gain early momentum, but these efforts were offset by the endorsement of Carney by the Delaware Democratic Party. Markell closed in the polls slowly until election day when Carney still held a small lead.\nMarkell won an upset victory over Carney, with 51.2% of the vote in the Democratic primary. Against former judge William Swain Lee, who also had been the Republican nominee for governor in 2004, Markell won the general election with 67% of the vote.",
        "2012": "Markell won a second term on November 6, 2012, defeating Republican challenger Jeff Cragg by nearly 40 points.",
        "First term": "InaugurationAccording to The News Journal, Markell's 2009 inauguration ceremony was held in the middle of the night to comply with the requirements of the state constitution that the governor be inaugurated on the third Tuesday of January and to allow Delaware residents to enjoy the historic event that would occur later that day: the inauguration of President Barack Obama and his vice president, Delaware's Joseph R. Biden Jr. A traditional swearing-in ceremony was held the following day on Legislative Mall in Dover, Delaware.\nBudgetMarkell entered office with an unprecedented budget challenge, facing a deficit of almost $800,000,000. One of his first actions was to cut his own salary by 20%. Markell announced his plan to balance the budget in March 2009. Avoiding lay-offs, Markell's plan included an 8% pay cut for state employees, legalization and taxation of sports betting, over $200 million worth of cuts, and revenue enhancements on such things as liquor and tobacco.After failing to obtain an initial majority in the House of Representatives, Markell's sports betting proposal was approved on a second vote in May 2009. Legislation legalizing sports betting was quickly approved by the state senate, and signed into law by the governor. Initial estimates of revenue for the state from sports betting were between 50 and 60 million dollars.  Current revenues estimates are lower following a decision by the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals banning single game bets.Following late night budget negotiations at Legislative Hall, a compromise budget was passed by the General Assembly and signed at 4 AM on July 1, avoiding a budget crisis and government shut down.  Several states in similar circumstances were unable to meet their budget deadlines and were forced to cut or close down many government offices and programs.\nThe FY 2011 budget focuses on job creation and economic development, counteracted by a reduction in the number of state employees. Compared to the 2009 budget, the new budget is $50 million less and includes 1,026 fewer state positions.\nEnvironmentFollowing through on several campaign promises early in his term, Markell signed energy legislation aimed to reduce Delaware's energy consumption by 15% by 2015, updating building codes, and mandating that renewable energy be considered first when expanding supplies. Markell also creates a new recycling program, which would require both public and private waste collectors to offer curbside recycling pickups at least once every other week and provide containers. \"The recycling bill was the home run of the year.\" said state Senator David McBride. A new clean energy bill will require utilities to rely on clean energy for 25% of their energy. This law also promotes shared solar installations and supports smaller green-energy projects.\nLGBT rightsOn July 2, 2009, Markell signed legislation banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, insurance, public accommodations and employment, ending a ten-year battle. On May 11, 2011, Markell also signed a civil union bill, which became effective on January 1, 2012.\nEducationMarkell proposed and signed major educational reform initiatives, including abolishing the controversial Delaware Student Testing Program, establishing a pilot program to reward improving schools, and passing legislation to improve transparency and autonomy within school districts.Markell facilitated the acquisition of the Newark Chrysler plant by the University of Delaware (UD) to build a research and technology campus that may generate both employment and local innovation. UD President Patrick Harker stated: \"Our goal over time is to construct high performance facilities that support the University's Climate Action Plan and restore portions of the land and natural features.\"In March 2010, Delaware placed first out of the 16 finalists in the federal government's grant competition for innovative education reform, making the state eligible to receive as much as $119 million. The money received will be used to identify and better Delaware's low-performing schools, improve the system for evaluating students, and raise the standard for and improve the quality of the state's educators.\nState economyIn addition to reduced state revenue, the current economic environment has driven rising unemployment. In response, Markell initiated several economic development initiatives, including the LIFT Program, meant to ensure the survival and growth of small businesses.Following the closure of the GM plant in July 2009, Markell and his team pursued Fisker Automotive. Although in competition with several other states, a deal was signed to reopen the facility after just over two months of negotiations. Fisker will invest a minimum of US$175 million in upgrading the plant. Production of hybrid sedans will begin as early as 2011 for the domestic market as well as for export through the Port of Wilmington. Fisker anticipates that the process will create approximately 2,500 jobs and contribute to Delaware's effort to compete in the \"green economy.\"In 2010, when Valero announced that they were closing their Delaware City Refinery, Markell aided in the negotiations with Valero, allowing PBF Energy to purchase the refinery. The refinery became operational in 2011, and Markell and PBF agreed that the company would receive economic development incentives in exchange for providing 600 full-time jobs.Sallie Mae, one of the nation's largest providers of student loans, decided to relocate their headquarters to Delaware. The company expects to hire as many as 1,500 Delawareans over the next five years. Thanks to the Delaware Strategic Fund, a state program that can provide economic incentives to companies thinking of moving to Delaware, Markell and his economic development team have also succeeded in attracting businesses such as Sanosil International and Testing Machines Inc.In June 2010, Markell signed into law the Business Finder's Fee Tax Credit or \"BFF\", which provides incentives for companies that bring new jobs to the state. \"The BFF program will make us more effective and efficient by enlisting Delawareans across the state to search for more opportunities to create jobs,\" said Markell.",
        "Second term": "Budget and economyLike Markell's first term, the slow national economic recovery left Delaware with a budget shortfall.  In order to sign a constitutionally mandated balanced budget, Markell proposed a budget for fiscal year 2014 that included an extension of some 2009 revenue enhancements.  While his budget extended previous tax increases, he also proposed to decrease tax rates where possible.  He signed bills extending the tax rates in March 2013 and a full budget on July 1, 2013.Facing a $139 million budget shortfall for 2015, Markell's proposed budget included a series of targeted tax increases and spending cuts.  Markell's budget called for increases in taxes on LLC (Limited Liability Corporations) formation and the state's minimum corporate franchise tax.  In an effort to boost jobs and improve the state's infrastructure, Markell also presented a $500 million transportation infrastructure initiative to be paid for by a 10-cent increase in the state's gas tax.\nLGBT rightsOn May 7, 2013, Markell signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in Delaware, making Delaware the eleventh state in the nation to expand marriage rights to same-sex couples. A little over one month later, Markell signed legislation banning discrimination in employment, housing, insurance, public accommodations, and public works for transgender individuals.\nCampaign financeFollowing a legislative task force on election laws and a campaign finance report issued by special prosecutor Norman Veasey, Markell joined with nearly two dozen legislators to introduce a series of six bills to combat corruption and strengthen state campaign finance laws.  The bills, among other goals, would enhance investigative powers for election officials, expand disclosure requirements, and protect \"whistleblowers\" seeking to expose campaign finance violations.\nGun controlResponding to a renewed national dialogue surrounding pervasive gun violence following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Markell joined with Attorney General Beau Biden to introduce a series of five bills designed to curb gun violence.  The proposals included requirements for reporting stolen or lost guns, a ban on certain assault weapons and high capacity magazine, universal background checks, new safeguards against licensing firearms to individuals with serious mental health issues, and a ban on firearms within 1000 feet of a school.Not all of Markell's proposals passed the state legislature during the 2013 session.  By July 2013, Markell had signed legislation on lost or stolen firearms and universal background checks.  Legislation preventing firearms from being legally sold to individuals with serious mental illness failed in the state senate, despite the NRA remaining neutral and the House passing the same legislation by a vote of 40 to 1.\nEnvironmentIn March 2014, Markell proposed an $800 million effort to clean Delaware's long-neglected waterways.  Announcing the new initiative, Markell said, \"\"Somebody has to do this [...] We have a fundamental responsibility, I believe, to leave the next generation cleaner water \u2013 water you can fish in, water you can swim in, not as many problems with drinking water, not as many problems with stormwater and all that flooding. ... It's just not acceptable and it's embarrassing.\" Markell proposes to pay for the new initiative through a series of loans and a small tax on water usage by homeowners, which would average around $45 a year.\nMinimum wageHeading President Barack Obama's call for an increase in the minimum wage, Markell signed legislation increasing Delaware's minimum wage to $8.25 an hour in March 2014.  The increase boosts wages for 40,000 Delawareans, or roughly 10% of the state's workforce.\nEducationMarkell's World Language Expansion Initiative created language immersion programs at the elementary school level in either Mandarin or Spanish for Delaware children in grades K-8.  By 2022, it is expected that 10,000 students will participate.  In recognition of this accomplishment and of his support for world language and culture learning, Markell received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in 2013.\nIn August 2014, Markell signed House Bill 340 that requires school to have updated plans for a variety of emergency situations. The bill was considered a part of the governor's \"state-of-the-art school safety plan\" by the end of 2014 pledge.",
        "Campaign finance violations": "In December 2013, following a lengthy investigation, special prosecutor E. Norman Veasey released a 101-page report that found that some campaign donors contributed in excess of the legal limits to several state campaigns, including Markell's 2008 race. The report found that personal emails from Markell to several of his contributors advised them on the parameters of the campaign laws, information that the donors later used to donate beyond the legal limit. Special prosecutor Veasey released evidence that even when presented with information from donors that would identify their ownership in a business as being beyond the allowable limit for multiple donations, Markell and his campaign accepted funds above and beyond legal limits.  The information that revealed that the donors were exceeding the allowable limit, however, was provided to the Markell campaign, along with the donations, in a column on a spreadsheet that was only viewable by using \"formatting features on the spreadsheet software.\" Special prosecutor Veasey did not press charges against elected officials as the statute of limitations had expired and they found \"no credible evidence\" that Markell's campaign had intentionally broken the law; however, multiple donors had previously pleaded guilty for their participation.",
        "Presidential politics": "After being elected by a large margin in 2008, Markell served as chairman of the Democratic Governors Association and the National Governors Association, before being re-elected by an even larger margin of over 40%. This record-setting margin and his overall national profile led some to believe that he wanted to seek the Democratic nomination in 2016, though he did not run. Although Markell expressed interest, he also said that he would support Joe Biden if he were to run.",

        "2022 U.S. Senate campaign": "It was reported in December 2021 that McCormick was being recruited by Republicans to run for the open Senate seat in Pennsylvania that was held by retiring Senator Pat Toomey.

An automatic recount was triggered due to the voting margin being less than 0.5 percent. The recount ultimately failed to help McCormick whose campaign launched a court case to have undated mail-in ballots counted with the rest of the votes. The mail-in ballots were seen as potentially helping McCormick should they be included. However McCormick later conceded the race to Oz and dropped the court case.  He lost to Oz by a margin of less than 1,000 votes.During the primary, McCormick released campaign televised advertisements questioning Oz's stances on conservative issues such as abortion and gun rights, referring to Oz as a \"Hollywood liberal\" and a \"RINO\" (Republican In Name Only).

The agency gained a higher profile under President Obama, who made small businesses a cornerstone of his effort to revive the economy in the wake of the Great Recession. Mills, a democrat, was confirmed as Administrator of the SBA at a critical time in early 2009 when the small business lending market had ground to a halt, including SBA-backed lending. She oversaw implementation of key provisions of President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, including the waiving of fees on SBA-backed loans and increasing the agency's government guarantee on loans made by private sector lenders.

She received praise for her leadership of the agency from the lending industry because of her work to tackle outdated regulations, bureaucracy and strengthening and simplifying the agency's core loan programs. During her tenure, the agency supported more than $106 billion in lending to more than 193,000 small businesses, including two record years of SBA-backed lending and three record years of investments made through the Small Business Investment Company program.

He served in this position until January 2015. During this time, he pursued comprehensive national reforms by implementing a functional reorganization of institutions, structures and processes. He steadfastly supported the drastic downsizing of the Public Sector and the structural reform of the tax administration.\nIn 2015, Mitsotakis served as a parliamentary representative for New Democracy, representing the President of the party in Parliament, as well as the body of the party's Representatives. He was charged with expressing the positions of his party during Parliamentary procedures and discourse, as well as ensuring the proper function of Parliament through a process of checks and balances. In March 2015, he claimed that then-Minister of Finance Yanis Varoufakis was undermining the Greek negotiations over the third bailout programme, saying: \"Every time he opens his mouth, he creates a problem for the country's negotiating position.\"\n\nMitsotakis was the first of four New Democracy members to announce their candidacy in the leadership election, declared following the resignation of Antonis Samaras as party leader and the failure of New Democracy in the September 2015 snap election. Amongst the other contestants was then-interim leader and former Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament Vangelis Meimarakis. According to the Financial Times, Mitsotakis was \"billed as an outsider in the leadership race\" due to the party establishment's support of Meimarakis' candidacy. Following the first round of voting with no clear winner, Mitsotakis came second, 11% behind Meimarakis.\n\nOn 10 January 2016, Mitsotakis was elected president of the New Democracy political party succeeding Ioannis Plakiotakis (transitional president) with almost 4% difference from opponent Vangelis Meimarakis. A week following Mitsotakis' election as leader, two opinion polls were published that put New Democracy ahead of Syriza for the first time in a year.His party won 33% of the votes in the European elections in 2019. He managed to win back votes from the Golden Dawn Party. Following the election results, the Hellenic Parliament was dissolved and a snap election was called.",
        "Prime Minister of Greece": "New Democracy was victorious in the 2019 legislative election, scoring 39.85% of votes and securing 158 seats in the Hellenic Parliament.\nOn 8 July 2019, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos accepted Tsipras' resignation and tasked Mitsotakis with forming a new government. Mitsotakis was sworn in as prime minister the same day as well. On 9 July, the ministers in his government were sworn in. Among his cabinet was Makis Voridis, a former member of the far-right Popular Orthodox Rally, who was met with a cold reception abroad and by the Jewish community in Greece. Israel announced that it would not cooperate with Voridis.From 2019 onwards, it is launching a wave of privatizations, including tourism infrastructure, coastal land, and state-owned shares in the gas and electricity companies and Athens airport. On the other hand, a tax reform aimed at making the country \"a haven for billionaires and the wealthiest citizens\", the Financial Times notes, is being implemented. The aim is to attract investment by offering low tax rates. A clause will protect the beneficiaries of this tax policy from possible policy changes by future governments.The \"big growth bill\", adopted in the summer of 2020, provides for the restriction of the right to strike and the abolition of collective agreements, which had already been suspended in 2012 at the request of the Troika and then reinstated by the Tsipras government. Migration policy has been tightened: the coverage of hospital care for destitute foreigners has been abolished and the period during which refugees who have been granted asylum can reside in public housing has been reduced from six months to one month. On environmental issues, the government reformed legislation to facilitate oil exploration.Mitsotakis' government has been praised by observers for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as for its plans for spending a \u20ac31bn share of the EU's Recovery Plan and for its orderly vaccination roll-out. Additionally, the common Covid-19 certificate was credited to Mitsotakis, and his idea has been taken up at a European level. Mitsotakis had criticized the initially slow pace of the EU's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and he had called for its acceleration.Measures were implemented from March to May 2020 and from November 2020 until May 2021, when their gradual lifting started. The controls included the introduction of various movement restrictions, the suspension of operation of retail, catering and entertainment businesses, as well as schools and churches.In August 2020, a reform of the labour law was adopted. It provides for the possibility of an employer to dismiss employees without having to give reasons for the decision or give prior notice to the persons concerned. The tax authorities' anti-fraud unit was abolished and its employees integrated into the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThere is a long-standing dispute between Turkey and Greece over natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Mitsotakis said that Turkey \"remains stuck in the logic of using force and threats.\" He told NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that Greece is \"contributing to NATO, we are an ally and have the expectation that when another NATO ally is behaving in a way that jeopardises our interests, NATO should not adopt this stance of equal distances and non-intervention in internal differences. It is deeply unfair to Greece.\"In July 2020, Mitsotakis awarded honorary Greek citizenship to American actor Tom Hanks and his wife, American actress Rita Wilson, the latter of whom is half Greek.On May 16, 2022, Mitsotakis met with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House. On the next day, Mitsotakis became the first Prime Minister of Greece to address a Joint session of the United States Congress at the invitation of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.During Mitsotakis' term as PM, he has received praise for being pro-European and governing technocratic, his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, his handling of migration, and his handling of the Greek economy, with Greece being named the Top Economic Performer for 2022 by the Economist. This was in particular due to Greece in 2022 being able to repay ahead of schedule 2.7 billion euros ($2.87 billion) of loans owed to euro zone countries under the first bailout it received during its decade-long debt crisis. Although Mitsotakis has also received criticism as Greece has experienced a democratic backsliding and heightened corruption, with a deterioration of freedom of the press, and was marred by the Novartis corruption scandal and the 2022 wiretapping scandal.",
        "Migration": "Mitsotakis adopted a hardline stance on the European Migrant Crisis by resorting to human rights violations, including pushbacks of thousands of migrants in an attempt to prevent their entry into Greece. He received praise from the European Union for his handling of the crisis and received economic support of \u20ac700m.",
        "Lockdown violations": "In December 2020, Mitsotakis was criticized after a photo of him surfaced on social media, in which he posed with five other people while not wearing a mask, during a time when Greece had a nationwide lockdown and mask wearing was mandatory both indoors and outdoors.  On 6 February 2021 Mitsotakis visited the island of Icaria to inspect the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations in the area. During this visit, he attended a lunch organized by MP Christodoulos I. Stefanadis along with his entourage numbering up to 40 people. The incident was covered by both Greek and international media and Mitsotakis was heavily criticized for violating the existing COVID-19 containment measures. Mitsotakis publicly apologized for the Icaria incident, saying this will never happen again and that \"the image hurt the citizens\".",
        "Mandatory COVID-19 measures and vaccinations": "In May 2021, when the Mitsotakis government announced the country's opening for tourism on 14 May, it was criticised initially, because movement control measures, such as the obligation to send an SMS at particular sites, were retained temporarily. Other measures still in place after the re-opening of tourism were the daily curfew, from 00:30, the obligatory use of face masks indoors and outdoors, the ban on music in cafes and restaurants, and the ban on the operation of indoor restaurants throughout May. Casinos were allowed to operate, with a specific sanitary protocol. In an interview on 27 May 2021, Mitsotakis did not give a clear answer as to when and if the above measures would be lifted in the summer. He referred to a roadmap for lifting the controls, but did not elaborate. He also estimated that tourism in 2021 in Greece would be around 50% of levels experienced in 2019. Despite criticism, Greece was awarded the \"Global Champion Award for COVID-19 Crisis Management\" by the World Travel and Tourism Council, which \"commends\" the Greek Government as \"a global example for the safe opening of the tourism sector during the pandemic.\"",
        "Press freedom": "Under Mitsotakis, Greece has declined in press freedom. Violence against journalists has also increased, resulting to a deterioration of the Greek freedom of the press.",
        "Wiretapping Scandal": "In July 2022, the leader of political party PASOK, Nikos Androulakis, revealed that there was an attempt of bugging his phone with spyware program \"Predator\". In a closed-door parliamentary hearing that was called by Androulakis, the chief of Greek Intelligence Service, P. Kontoleon, admitted that his service had spied Greek journalist Thanassis Koukakis, who has also complained about being targeted by \"Predator\". After the publication of an investigation by Efsyn and Reporters United that Grigoris Dimitriadis, Mitsotakis's nephew and general secretary, had connections with Felix Bitsios, the owner of the company that markets the \"Predator\", Dimitriadis submitted his resignation. Shortly after, the chief of Greek Intelligence Service, Panagiotis Kontoleon, also stepped down over an allegation that his service had tapped Androulakis's phone. Mitsotakis himself has actively worked to block any investigation on the wiretapping scandal from concluding.",
        "Personal life": "Mitsotakis is the younger brother of former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mayor of Athens Dora Bakoyannis, making him the brother-in-law of the late Pavlos Bakoyannis, who was assassinated by the terrorist group 17 November in 1989 and the uncle of Kostas Bakoyannis, former Regional Governor of Central Greece and current Mayor of Athens.\nMitsotakis is married to Mareva Grabowska, an investment banker with British, Greek, Polish and Egyptian roots. They have three children, Sophia, Konstantinos and Daphne.In addition to Greek, Mitsotakis speaks English, French and German.",

In 2021, he was summoned by the Delhi Legislative Assembly's Peace and Harmony Committee to appear as a witness on behalf of Facebook India in connection with the 2020 Delhi riots. A representative of the Assembly said Mohan was asked to lend his expertise and provide recommendations in order to prevent similar incidents fueled by social media, and no \"coercive action\" was intended. According to The Hindu, Mohan told the Supreme Court \"that he was well within his rights to remain silent\" and \"[did] not wish to be part of a highly polarised political debate\". He \"accused the Assembly of threatening him with 'breach of privilege' if he did not appear before the Committee to testify\" and filed a plea, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court in July. Instead of Mohan, Facebook India's public policy director appeared before the Committee in November.Mohan holds the same role at Meta India, following Facebook Inc.'s rebrand in 2021.

        "Abe government": "Following the LDP's victory in the 2012 general election, resulting in Shinzo Abe's election as prime minister, Motegi was named Minister for Economy, Trade, and Industry.\nHe left the Cabinet in September 2014 to serve as Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party Election Committee.

        "Suga and Kishida governments": "After Abe's resignation as Prime Minister, his successor Yoshihide Suga  opted to retain Motegi as foreign minister after taking office in September 2020. As Suga was known to be weak in foreign affairs, this gave Motegi an opportunity to build his reputation and brand, while maintaining the foreign policy initiatives from the Abe government.In October 2020, Motegi met with U.K. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss to sign a bilateral economic partnership agreement estimated to raise British exports to Japan by 17.2% (\u00a5355 billion) and Japanese exports to Britain by 79.9% (\u00a51.775 trillion).

Nikkei noted that this sent a message of continuity in Japan's policies toward China and Taiwan.He was appointed Secretary-General of the LDP after the resignation of the previous incumbent Akira Amari following the 2021 general elections. He leads one of the main factions of the LDP party and is rumored to be a potential contender to become Prime Minister."

He has worked as a  director and CEO of Africa Technology and Business Institute since September 2003. Under a September 2008 power-sharing agreement, Mutambara served in the government as one of two Deputy Prime Ministers from 2009 to 2013.",
        "Early activism": "Mutambara was president of the Student Representative Council of the University of Zimbabwe in 1988 and 1989. He led anti-government protests at the University of Zimbabwe which led to his arrest and imprisonment. He was later educated on a Rhodes Scholarship in 1991, at Merton College, Oxford in the United Kingdom where he obtained a DPhil in Robotics and Mechatronics, and in the United States where he spent time as a visiting Fellow in the same field, including both California Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Florida A & M University \u2013 Florida State University College of Engineering. He also worked as a lecturer on Business Strategy and as a consultant for McKinsey & Company.Mutambara criticised government ministers for abusing Zimbabwe's land reform program, engaging in: \"monopolistic politics of domination, corruption, and petty bourgeois accumulation.\"Mutambara, a self-professed admirer of Che Guevara, has also expressed his intention to visit Cuba to learn more about its \"successful resistance\" to American sanctions. Mutambara added: \"We have a lot to learn from Cuba which started its revolution in 1959, we will continue with our solidarity, continue with the struggle and strengthen our co-operation.\"",

According to Scopus as of 2013 his h-index was a modest 4.",
        "Movement for Democratic Change": "In 2005 the MDC split into two factions following a dispute over whether or not to participate in the March 2005 senatorial election. While MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, Mutambara, and others opposed participation, Welshman Ncube and Gibson Sibanda led a faction that favoured participation. Those supporting the senate elections won narrowly against the leader Morgan Tsvangirai's vote. Tsvangirai later overruled and overturned the decision of the plebiscite citing two absent members had sent in postal votes that canceled the slender margin.In February 2006 at a Congress of the breakaway faction Movement for Democratic Change, Mutambara was elected as president of the party. Commenting on the election, Mutambara said, \"My position was that the MDC should have boycotted those Senate elections. I guess then that makes me the anti-Senate leader of the pro-Senate MDC faction. How ridiculous can we get? That debate is now in the past, let us move on and unite our people.\"The choice of Mutambara as leader was said to have been inspired by the fact that he is a Shona whereas Sibanda and Ncube are both Ndebele, but realised that only a Shona candidate could win an election across the whole of Zimbabwe. Mutambara is not a member of the House of Assembly.\nThe faction led by Tsvangirai described Mutambara's election as a nullity. In his MDC faction presidential acceptance speech, Mutambara stated, \"We believe that our views on land reform in Zimbabwe are different from those of Western governments. Our approach is not driven by the interests of white farmers, but by those of all Zimbabweans, white and black. While we put the failure of the land reform program squarely on the ZANU\u2013PF government, we also acknowledge the complicity of some Western governments which reneged on agreements, and the inertia of white farmers in seeking pre-emptive solutions.\" However, David Karimanzira, a leading member of the ZANU\u2013PF, alleged that Mutambara was promoted by the West after Western governments decided not to continue backing Morgan Tsvangirai because the Zimbabwean people had allegedly rejected his party manifesto. He once called the African Union a \"club of dictators\".Mutambara was arrested by the Zimbabwe police on 19 May 2006 while leading a march in support of his faction's candidate on the eve of the Budiriro by-election. He was also arrested on 11 March together with other MDC leaders from the other faction. He was released without charge two days later, only to be re-arrested on 18 March at Harare Airport en route to South Africa, where his family is still based, and where he is also a leading consultant. He was also released without charge after three days in custody.",
        "2008 presidential election": "After Mutambara and Tsvangirai failed to unite on a single MDC candidate for the March 2008 presidential election, Mutambara said on 15 February that he would not run for president and that his faction would instead back Simba Makoni. Mutambara instead ran in the concurrent parliamentary election for a seat from the Zengeza East constituency, but he was placed third, with 1,322 votes, according to official results, behind the candidate of the Tsvangirai faction, who won 7,570 votes, and the ZANU\u2013PF candidate, who won 3,042 votes.The Tsvangirai faction won 99 seats in the parliamentary election and the Mutambara faction won 10, compared with 97 for ZANU\u2013PF. On 28 April 2008, Mutambara and Tsvangirai announced that their factions were reuniting, thus enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority.On 1 June 2008, Mutambara was arrested at his home in Harare. According to his lawyer, the arrest was due to an article he wrote in The Standard in April, which allegedly included \"falsehoods\" and \"contempt of court\". In this article, he blamed Mugabe for the state of the economy and accused the security forces of committing abuses. On 3 June, Mutambara was released on a bail of 20 million Zimbabwean dollars but he did not go to jail, with the next court date being set for 17 June. After the hearing on 3 June, he described his own suffering as minor compared to that of the people, saying that Mugabe's \"human rights violations\" would fail and vowing, \"We will triumph over evil.\"",
        "SADC facilitated power-sharing agreement": "On 15 September 2008, the leaders of the 14-member Southern African Development Community witnessed the signing of a power-sharing agreement between the two MDC factions and ZANU-PF. Under the deal, Mugabe remained president, Tsvangirai became prime minister, the MDC controlled the police, ZANU-PF controlled the Army, and Mutambara became deputy prime minister."

        "Early life and education": "Nayeri was born in Isfahan, Iran. Her mother was a doctor and her father a dentist. She spent the first 8 years of her life in Isfahan but fled Iran with her mother and brother Daniel in 1988 because her mother had converted to Christianity and the moral police of the Islamic Republic had threatened her with execution. Nayeri, her mother and brother spent two years in Dubai and Rome as asylum seekers and eventually settled in Oklahoma, in the United States. Her father remained in Iran, where he still lives.\nNayeri holds a Bachelor of Arts from Princeton University and a Master of Education and MBA from Harvard University.

        "Refuge": "Her second novel, Refuge, was published in 2017, also by Riverhead Books. Refuge is a semi-autobiographical novel whose chapters are written alternately from the point of view of Niloo Hamidi, an Iranian woman who emigrated to the United States and, at the time of the novel, is teaching anthropology at a university in Amsterdam, and Bahman Hamidi, her father, a dentist and oral surgeon living in Isfahan, Iran. Niloo's chapters relating her current life in the Netherlands are in the third person, as are Bahman's chapters, while flashback chapters about Niloo's four visits with her father in four different cities are narrated in the first person by Niloo.\nThe novel is partly about a father-daughter relationship and partly about the refugee crisis that is affecting all of Europe, with particular focus on the Iranian refugee community in Netherlands.\nWhen Niloo was forced to leave Iran with her mother and brothers, her father stayed behind. Niloo, who had a deep and joyous bond with her baba, was shocked by this and expected that he would join then. Bahman, however, went on to remarry, first a peasant woman with a young daughter, then, after divorcing her, a young and attractive woman. The novel starts with Bahman waiting for an audience with a divorce judge, a cleric, to obtain a divorce from his third wife. Bahman's third divorce constitutes the plot line of the chapters about present-day Bahman.\nAs attested by a personal essay published in The New Yorker, many of Niloo's circumstances and adventures, including the four visits with her father, are modeled closely on real events in the author's life. Unlike the author's real-life brother, Niloo's brother Kian is a chef (the New Yorker article indicates that the author's real-life brother is a businessman) and is not married. There is no mention of his having a romantic interest.",

        "Introduction": "Naheed Kurban Nenshi (born February 2, 1972) is a Canadian politician who was the 36th mayor of Calgary, Alberta. He was elected in the 2010 municipal election with 39% of the vote, and is the first Muslim mayor of a large North American city. He was re-elected in 2013 with 74% of the vote and again re-elected in 2017 to a third term with 51% of the vote. After serving three terms as mayor, he did not seek re-election in the 2021 Calgary municipal election, and was succeeded by Jyoti Gondek.",
        "Early life, education, and career": "Nenshi was born in Toronto, Ontario, and raised in Calgary. His parents, Kurbanali Hussein and Noorjah, were Ismaili Muslims of Gujarati origin who immigrated to Canada from Tanzania.He was educated at the University of Calgary, serving as President of the Students' Union and receiving a Bachelor of Commerce in 1993, and completed a Master of Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1998. Nenshi worked for McKinsey & Company for several years before starting his own consulting firm 'Ascend Group' which advised non-profit, private and public sector organizations. The firm also advised the United Nations on ways to encourage wealthy corporations to engage in Corporate Citizenship. As a young professional, he developed his administrative capabilities by joining Canada25, a federal networking organization that mentored professionals under 35 of public policy and leadership. Nenshi was a constant debate opponent of Toronto Sun journalist Ezra Levant; Levant later became a recurring critic of Nenshi's policies.In 2002, Nenshi wrote about how cities can retain young professionals and use resources effectively in a publication entitled \"Building Up: Making Canada's Cities Engines of Growth and Magnets of Development\". In 2006, Nenshi was the chief author for \"ImagineCalgary's 100-year plan\".\nHe has co-founded two citizens' groups aimed at improving Calgary's civic government. In 2009, Nenshi was invited to become a founding member of Civic Camp, an active citizenship forum that encourages and enables Calgarians to actively engage and collaborate ideas in civic affairs. He co-founded city hall watch dog group \"Better Calgary Campaign\".He was an instructor in non-profit management in the Bissett School of Business at Mount Royal University and wrote a regular municipal affairs column for the Calgary Herald.",
        "Electoral record": "No information",
        "2010 mayoral election": "Nenshi first ventured into politics in 2004, running unsuccessfully for a seat on Calgary's city council. His 2010 campaign for mayor, dubbed the \"Purple Revolution\", was uniquely a viral campaign which relied heavily on using social media to promote his platform and hyper-engage voters. According to Nenshi's campaign I.T. specialist Richard Einarson, the name \"Purple Revolution\" was chosen because the campaign wanted broad appeal across the socio-economic spectrum of liberal red and conservative blue voters.Beside viral campaigning, the volunteer body of \"Team Nenshi\" were given a great degree of autonomy to exercise creative talent. The team promoted the cause through creative guerrilla marketing tactics such as \"Operation Purple Dawn\". Nenshi's supporters converged on the city in a mass rally on the evening before election day. They advertised Nenshi by posting signs and writing platform slogans with chalk graffiti on pavement of high traffic locations. Supporters offered their homes as venues for coffee parties where Nenshi spoke to the gathered about his platform. The coffee parties offered a friendly atmosphere for friends to discuss the volatile nature of sensitive political issues without risking their relationships. About 40 parties were held during the campaign.A late September poll showed that his campaign was generating interest as he sat third with eight per cent support, although well behind the leaders, alderman Ric McIver (42%) and local media personality Barb Higgins (28%). His growing popularity led to greater scrutiny of his views, including a public dispute with Calgary Police Service chief Rick Hanson over the cost of policing the city.Days before the election, a Calgary Herald poll showed that Nenshi's grassroots campaign continued to gain momentum as he had 30 per cent support among decided voters, placing him in a statistical tie with McIver and Higgins. He polled the strongest amongst younger voters, believed to be the result of his social media campaign. Nenshi's surge in popularity carried through to the election, when he earned 40 per cent of the vote, finishing nearly 28,000 votes ahead of second-placed McIver.Being a Shia Ismaili, Nenshi became the first Muslim to become mayor of a major Canadian city. His win was viewed as a breakthrough for the use of social media as an election tool, and when considered with his faith and background, made international headlines. His election is seen as major signal of the shift in Albertan politics and the demography of Calgary. He engaged voters with a mutual two-way dialogue as \"politics in full sentences\".",
        "Vandalism and email attacks": "On September 11, 2010, 20 of Nenshi's campaign advertisements in the city were vandalized or destroyed and a brick was thrown through one of his campaign office's windows. The attacks, which commemorated the ninth anniversary of the September 11 attacks in New York City, were accompanied by a series of racially antagonistic emails. They were therefore widely assumed to be racially motivated.",
        "2013 mayoral election": "No information",
        "2013 mayoral campaign": "During this fundraising Gala, Nenshi issued a challenge to his opponents to confront him directly and not to engage him in a proxy campaign of lobbying as he warns his supporters that his opponents will likely engage in.In September 2013 when Nenshi's campaign began in earnest, he revealed the donors of his campaign before the election and urged his opponents to do likewise. Nenshi promised to instigate changes to improve the transparency of City Hall's municipal affairs as one of his 2010 campaign statements. According to the documents Nenshi's 1631 supporters derive from a wide range of core supporters. Among Nenshi's larger contributors were contractors from the housing construction industry, which according to Nenshi indicates that not all among the trade were antagonistic to Nenshi's anti-urban sprawl policies enacted early in his term.",
        "Abolition of developer subsidy": "For his campaign platform, Nenshi proposed to abolish the $4,800 granted to home builders, aiming to save the city $33 million per annum. According to Nenshi, the subsidy over a decade contributed to the municipal debt of $1.5 billion. Nenshi wanted free market factors to take hold of the housing market and developers to contribute to funding infrastructure to far-reaching suburbs by paying levies. The Manning Centre for Building Democracy supported the motion as supporting free market principles. The group however believed developers should pay slightly increased taxes as long as inner city communities equally also contribute their share of growth costs.",
        "International Avenue business redevelopment zone": "In October 2013, Nenshi and Councillors Andre Chabot and Gian-Carlo Carra proposed to realize a 2008 plan by then-Mayor Dave Bronconnier to redevelop International Avenue (17th Ave SE) as a vital transportation hub. Since inception of the plan in 2010, the project has been delayed due to costs. The plan incorporates a C-train line and rapid bus lanes, proposed in Calgary Transit's 'Route Ahead' plan. As well, the revitalization incorporates urban renewal projects like renovated apartments and business buildings. Carra studied the circumstances for Forest Lawn's urban decay and planned the neighborhood's restoration as his master thesis. Carra explained that the neighbourhood had not been adequately integrated since it was incorporated into the city of Calgary in 1961.",
        "2017 mayoral election": "Nenshi indicated his intention to run for a 3rd term on November 4, 2016. On October 16, 2017, Nenshi won a third term winning over 50% of the vote. The third election has been wrought with controversy as select neighbourhoods ran out of ballots and waiting lines to vote were hours long, resulting in lost votes.\nOn April 6, 2021, Nenshi announced that he would not seek re-election for a 4th term in the 2021 Calgary municipal election. The election was won by councillor Jyoti Gondek.",
        "Mayoralty": "No information",
        "Positions": "In 2013, Nenshi supported the proposed Keystone XL pipeline network. He explained that opposition and protests were foolish as the pipe network could mitigate environmental damage caused from the transport of oil.In 2014, Nenshi refused to present musician Neil Young with a Calgary White Hat, a traditional token of the city's hospitality to prominent guests. Nenshi stated that he did not normally present honours to entertainers. Young was performing his Honour the Treaties benefit tour to raise legal funds on behalf of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation. The ACFN is appealing government approval to expand fracking on their territory.In 2014, Nenshi delivered a speech to the Calgary Economic Development speakers' series on diversity. Nenshi explained that there was a lack of ethnic and gender diversity among senior city staff. Nenshi stated that although the city had an excellent record hiring minorities and women they may experience a ceiling to promotions and advancement.In 2017 Calgary, as with many municipalities in Western Canada, recorded an increase in the number overdoses and fatalities related to an opioid epidemic. During conference of Canadian mayors, Nenshi invited the federal government to use Calgary as a test city to implement harm reductionist pilot projects and gather research indigenous to Calgary's unique needs.Although Nenshi's second term council voted to end addition of fluoride to Calgary's drinking water, he personally supports water fluoridation. He does however support more depth in the research literature related to municipal water fluoridation. Calgary has undertaken five plebiscites on water fluoridation, initially voting in favour of the practice in 1998. In 2016, the city council rejected a call for another vote, but in January 2019, Ward 11 Councillor Jeromy Farkas requested a report on the history and cost of water fluoridation from the city administration in preparation for a possible 2021 plebiscite.",
        "Relationship with housing industry": "Nenshi's policies of exercising greater city control over urban growth to manage urban sprawl is one of his key campaign promises. As expected, Nenshi's council has regularly collided with key associations of Calgary's housing industry. Frictions between the Nenshi council and key housing industry associations are an ongoing, overlapping, and escalating affair. Grievances continuously surfaced during the 2013 election, for example the \"Cal Wenzel video\", rumour-mongering about a pro-development slated council, and upcoming Wenzel slander lawsuit of 2014.Early in 2013, Nenshi's council suspended relations with the Calgary branch of the Canadian Home Builders' Association. The CHBA as a result was banned briefly from attending planning sessions. This action was conducted after the Calgary branch president Charron Ungar commented that the city was enacting a policy of \"suburban freeze\". Ungar commented upon a city plan which scheduled two suburb developments within 10 years.Nenshi declared that the CHBA and the Urban Development Institute (UDI) were representing the housing industry poorly after a controversial article was published by the UDI. The article suggested that minorities might not find suburban living comfortable. Nenshi suspended relations with the UDI soon after the article was published. Nenshi also felt that it was more expedient for the city to deal directly with the construction industry.",
        "Cal Wenzel housing lobby video": "In 2013, a video was leaked of Cal Wenzel, the CEO and founder of Shane Homes, speaking to panel of Calgarian home builders about a plan to influence the decisions of the city council after the upcoming elections. In the video Wenzel spoke of plans to raise $1.1 million to enlist the support of Preston Manning's conservative foundation the Manning Centre for Building Democracy. According to the speech, former Mayor Dave Bronconnier counselled Wenzel on how to control council motions with eight votes. \u201cSo for whatever and however, we have to ensure that we end up with the eight votes.\u201d Wenzel proposed as a solution to circumvent direct confrontation with Nenshi's popularity. Wenzel named councillors the industry could rely on to support motions in favour of the lobby and he supported with donations. Nenshi has ordered a probe into what he described as distasteful and shadowy possible violations of electoral laws. In the wake of the release of this video, and violations of campaign fund limits set at $5,000, the Manning Centre has come under scrutiny.In late 2013, Wenzel filed a $6 million slander lawsuit against Nenshi after he stated that Nenshi did not apologize after sufficient time given. Wenzel stated that his reputation was tarnished and he was vilified as a subject of political opportunism during Nenshi and his allied counselor's platform campaigning. Wenzel stated that his comments in the video were taken out of context and manipulated by Nenshi to promote an agenda. Wenzel also complained of Nenshi tentatively comparing him to 'Godfather', as a reference to the titular character of Mario Puzo's novel and screenplay The Godfather. Nenshi in an interview with David Gray, host of CBC Radio's Calgary Eyeopener, described the meeting as scene from the film The Godfather. When asked to clarify if called Wenzel the \"Godfather\", Nenshi ambiguously responded \"maybe\". The two reached an out-of-court settlement in December 2015, under which Nenshi agreed to apologize for and retract several comments he had made, while Wenzel expressed regret for any harm done to Nenshi's reputation and agreed that Nenshi has raised legitimate concerns about the potential chilling effect of lawsuits against politicians. Nenshi's legal bill of nearly $300,000 was paid by donations.",
        "Pro-development candidate slate": "Preston Manning, founder of the Manning Centre for Building Democracy, responded in an interview with CBC News about the foundation being referred to in the Cal Wenzel lobbyist video. He stated that Calgarians don't want lobby slates of any position in municipal politics, but rather independent candidates who will represent them. Manning explained that the purpose of the 'municipal government program' is to train fiscal conservative candidates for the election, but to respect the democratic process and not to interfere with city politics. Manning stated that he didn't believe in intimidation. Manning also states that the foundation is also to function as a research think tank that conducts research on social issues.\nHowever, according to a paper entitled \"Managing the Cost of Growth\" published by the Manning Centre in October 2013 the report's recommendations coincided with Nenshi's campaign policy to abolish the subsidy to home building companies As long as inner city communities are likewise subjected to contributing to growth costs. The study also advocated increased taxes for newer outlying communities that need specialized utilities such as water and roads.",
        "Calgary-Tsuu T'ina Nation relationships": "Throughout his term, Nenshi has met extensively with Chief Roy Whitney leader of neighbouring Tsuu T'ina Nation, and former Chief Sandford Big Plume to discuss matters of mutual assistance with growth.\nIn 2011, Nenshi and Big Plume negotiated tentative agreements to ensure the security of greater access safety services such as emergency medical services, police, and fire.The city agreed to provide utilities, such as water, to support the expansion of the Grey Eagle Casino, possibly allowing water works extension throughout the Tsuu T'ina community in the future.",
        "Comparison to Rob Ford": "The press has made many comparisons dubbed as \"Nenshi vs Ford\" comparing Nenshi to Mayor Rob Ford of Toronto, because of the similarities of both mayors being first term and the uncannily similar challenges Toronto and Calgary faced. Nenshi became the first Calgarian mayor to marshal the Calgary Pride parade. Ford declined to marshal the Toronto Pride Parade citing that visiting his family cottage was an unbreakable tradition. They compare the stellar rise of Nenshi to the controversies surrounding Ford.Although the comparisons are allegorical examples of the differences of the administration, there was an actual \"Nenshi vs Ford\" challenge issued by Nenshi. Nenshi challenged Ford to a friendly bet during the 2012 Grey Cup where the Calgary Stampeders played the Toronto Argonauts. In 2012 Ford challenged Nenshi among other mayors to a fitness weight loss challenge.",
        "Public works and infrastructure projects": "Soon after assuming the office, Nenshi's council implemented many developments to revitalize Calgary's viability with capital infrastructure projects, such as redevelopment of the East Village neighbourhood with the New Central Library and the National Music Centre. Through a partnership with the local arts community, the city will preserve the historic King Edward School as an arts hub. Funding for these projects will mainly draw upon the Community Investment Fund, a fund created from tax revenue sources such as a $42 million annual refund from the provincial governmentThe goals of urban revitalization are planned to be realized through initiatives such as Supporting Partnership for Urban Reinvestment (SPUR). Nenshi's council debuted SPUR's pilot project as the restoration of the Kingsland neighborhood. The city solicited feedback from the community and expects to budget $230,000. The project was delayed until August by the floods of 2013.\nThe Nenshi administration completed capital public works projects approved by his predecessor Dave Bronconnier, including the westerly extension of the C-Train line, Peace Bridge, and the construction of a traffic tunnel to the Calgary International Airport, which has been completed.Nenshi's council voted to discontinue fluoridating Calgary's water supply in February 2011.As part of his campaign, Nenshi advocated to legalize \"secondary housing\" as a solution to housing shortage. A proposed bylaw is intended to create standardized safety requirements for the estimated 10,000\u201340,000 secondary suites which exist in the city. As one of the last decisions of Nenshi's term in 2013, the city motioned to waive the $4,485 application fee for rezoning of secondary suites. However, the decision will have to be brought into effect during the next government's term.In 2013 the city approved a project to convert a block of derelict heritage buildings adjacent to the Central United Church into a first-of-its-kind robotic carpark. The facility will accommodate 338 cars and incorporate the renovated buildings, which the managing firm agrees to restore. Nenshi states this will improve the aesthetics of the eyesore skid row-like buildings. The project is planned to be self-funding as Calgary firm Heritage Property Corporation will attempt to raise the $40 million through private investment.Nenshi ordered an investigation to find cost-effective solutions for a sanitary capacity issues affecting residents of northwest Calgary. If the $50 million expansion of the at-capacity Bowness sanitary line is not implemented, development in new and established communities in the quadrant may be delayed until 2017. The sanitary line also provides the town of Cochrane, contributing to the strain.Nenshi expressed distaste of the free-standing public art project entitled the \"Travelling Light\" completed in 2013. He described the work as \"awful and not the best use of tax dollars\". The sculpture was sited along Airport Trail and drivers could not appreciate the \"Big O\" according to Nenshi. Travelling Light is described as a balanced 17-metre circle ring topped with balanced street lights. The motif of Travelling Light is supposed to represent transportation. The sculpture cost Calgary $471,000 and was paid through a grant from the Public Art Program, which reserves 1% of the annual budget for public art projects. The sculpture approved because of Nenshi's art initiative where a percentage of all city work had to be allocated to art. Travelling Light's submission was from a German artist, although three submissions were from Calgarians.",
        "City consultation with environmental research group": "Mounting international, domestic, and celebrity criticism of Alberta's underdeveloped green technology infrastructure prompted former Premier Ed Stelmach's government to commit $4 billion to a province-wide green capital projects plan in 2009.In 2009 former Calgary Mayor Dave Bronconnier and Pembina Institute were awarded the 'Reaching Out to Global Energy Award' at the UN Climate Change Summit for the technical and engineering collaboration with Calgary's \"Greening the Grid\" program.Pembina scholars compiled the 'Options for Reducing GHG Emissions in Calgary' to advise the city on how to implement infrastructure projects for environmental protection. The city acted on these recommendations through city-owned company Enmax; decided on a series of public works facilities such as the Shepard Energy Centre, and a 12-turbine wind farm that supplies wind power for Calgary Transit's C-trains, and the District Energy Centre, a heat capture energy plant providing heat and energy for the downtown core. The city publication of the \"Greening the Grid\" was entitled \"Calgary Climate Change Action Plan: Target (down arrow) 50\" (Target Minus 50).The \"Greening the Grid\" program's objectives are to empower city facilities by renewable sources by 2012. Calgary Transit's C-trains' electrical needs were partially provided by wind power in 2001, by 2009 the inception year of \"Greening the Grid\", the CTrain were fully empowered by \"Ride the Wind\", a program launched by Enmax and wind power engineers Vision Quest Windlectric. committed $250 million on the 'Greening the grid' program.In 2013, Sun Media journalist Ezra Levant said the city of Calgary contracted $340,000 to Pembina which he accused of being an anti-oil lobby group with insufficient scientific credentials.Sun Media journalist Renato Gandia mentioned the Pembina Institute's contracts in an article with the headline \"Mayor Naheed Nenshi says work done by left-leaning Pembina Institute think tank was not political in nature\". Nenshi said it would be reasonable to hire the \"best guy\" regardless of personal political values.\nThe affair concluded with a Twitter argument when Nenshi responded to Levant's questioning. Levant questioned Nenshi about the ethics of city funds going to Pembina, if Pembina staff had worked on or donated to Nenshi's political campaigns. Nenshi responded by asking Levant rhetorically 'when did you stop beating your wife?'",
        "Enmax": "Nenshi ordered a corruption graft probe into the finances of city-owned utility company Enmax after an unknown senior employee revealed lavish spending by former Enmax CEO Gary Holden in 2010 in an email report. Holden was reported to have organized extravagant house celebrations entertained by rock stars, using Calgarian taxpayers' funds. Holden also gradually raised his salary from $700,000 to $2.7 million Holden resigned in 2011 after CBC News revealed a business trip to Monaco in 2008. Holden was a guest of German software company SAP and conducted business and watched the Monaco Grand Prix. Holden violated Enmax ethics policy to disclose incidents of gifts over $100. Holden earned the 5th place distinction of Forbes top 10 CEO screw ups for 2010. By the terms of contract Holden was granted a significant severance pay of $4.6 million.Prior to the 2010 election, mayoral candidates McIver and Nenshi debated the justification for extravagant privileges of senior Enmax staff in their debates. Candidate Nenshi warned that Enmax was a city-run company and funds were taxpayers'. McIver described Enmax as an \"Air of Entitlement\". In 2011, in the wake of Holden's resignation, Nenshi's council and Enmax's board implemented reforms such as decreasing the salaries of senior staff, and a higher meritorious standard for bonuses. Enmax hired new management and a new CEO Gianna Manes, who is experienced in mass project completion such as the Shepard Energy Centre for which Holden advocated.In 2011, Nenshi performed the ground breaking ceremony for Enmax's Shepard Energy Centre, a natural gas power plant capable of generating 800MW, more than half the electrical needs of Calgary. The facility was announced fully operational on March 11, 2015. The facility is described as Calgary's biggest project and cost $1.4 billion. Nenshi's council approved of the project which was planned during Bronconnier's term. The Shepard Energy Centre is connected to the Albertan power grid.",
        "Public works of second term": "Nenshi's council granted $5.5 million to build the 200-seat \"Decidedly Jazz Danceworks Dance Centre\" in the Belt Line neighbourhood. The new facility will address the expansion requirements of the Decidedly Jazz dance academy. The council decided that the facility would address the need to provide a permanent venue for the distinguished academy that served Calgary for many years. According to Nenshi, the facility will also help to fill the need in Calgary for more performing arts venues. Nenshi also hopes that this development would help stimulate development in the Beltline.",
        "Transportation": "The city constructed its first of many bicycle lanes in the downtown core. By 2020, it is estimated that the city will have 30 km of cycle lanes. In 2014, a plan will be submitted to begin to extend the network and enact a bylaw.In late 2013, the city has entered into speculative agreement with the Tsuu T'ina to resume negotiating the extension of Stoney Trail through a portion of Tsuu T'ina land for a ring road. The band members were to vote in a referendum in October of the same year to decide on the issue. The city was in negotiations for over 50 years, with the last proposal in 2009 being rejected. Nenshi described the proposal as \"win-win-win\", however, should the band decide to ratify the agreement, construction won't commence for two years. On October 24, 2013, Tsuu T'ina tribe members voted in a referendum to permit the construction of the ring road on their territory. In exchange for 450 hectares of land, the nation will be compensated with 2,150 hectares of Crown land to expand their territories. The nation will also receive $340 million.",
        "Calgary Transit": "Calgary Transit presented Nenshi's administration with the \"RouteAhead\" plan for review. The plan calls for $13 billion to be invested over 30 years to expand and upgrade Calgary Transit's capabilities, for which funding is still pending. To address the problem of congestion of rush hour ridership, the city is upgrading busy C-train platforms to accommodate four-car trains. The city council has approved $200 million for the acquisition of 60 new four-car trains to replace obsolete U2 units which have served Calgary Transit since 1981. It is expected that the increased frequency of the trains will relieve crowded and full trains.Nenshi abolished the $3 park-and-ride fees to encourage more commuters to use Calgary's Public Transit.\nLater, the decision was made to charge a $70 monthly fee for reserved parking.",
        "Relationship with Canadian Pacific Railway": "After Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) cancelled an environmental study of the expansion of Alyth train yard, the city approved to continue funding the study environmental impact the yard causes the residents of adjacent Inglewood and Ramsay neighborhoods.

Transport Canada ordered it to relocate 400m away, as residents complained of the noise.Nenshi rebuked CP over the collapse of the 101-year-old Bonnybrook Bridge. The bridge was weakened by the 2013 Alberta floods, as its structural supports were washed away by surging flood waters. He blamed a massive layoff prior to the accident for lax inspection standards and called for cities to have greater management of CP affairs within their cities.Nenshi and CP agreed to improve communication in the future and improve relationships after several cars transporting petroleum derailed in late September 2013.",
        "Social initiatives and amendments to bylaws": "The Nenshi administration initiated many programs to improve civic administration and clarify transparency of city political affairs, organized around themes such as \"transforming government\" and \"cutting red tape\". These initiatives are intended to improve the business and quality of life for Calgarians. The Cutting red tape initiative was estimated to have saved Calgarians 33,000 in hours and $1.12 million in productivity. Nenshi sought the advice of Calgarians for further feedback and ideas of how to make city services easier to access in 2012 for its third phase of cutting red tape.The term alderman was changed to the gender-neutral councillor.In 2011, Nenshi was advised by civil advocacy group Civic Camp to challenge the citizens of Calgary with an initiative to personally take responsibility and encourage their neighbours do three things to improve their community for '3 Things for Calgary Program'.In 2013, Nenshi implemented the 'Enough for All' program to half the demographic of 50,000 Calgarians living in poverty by 2023. The plan doesn't call for more spending, but to uncover and administer effective solutions to connect disadvantaged Calgarians with resources and the community. Nenshi made implementing this solution as one of his campaign promises.\nThe town of Airdrie passed an anti-bullying bylaw that was advocated by Airdrie teen Mackenzie Murphy in 2013 after she survived a suicide attempt in December 2012. She was persecuted for two years by online bullying and at school as her classmates suggested that she should kill herself. Airdrie Mayor Peter Brown, who was sympathetic to her distress, tasked his council to investigate the legal precedence to enact the bylaws.She hopes to meet Nenshi to advocate for similar laws in Calgary and spread public awareness of bullying. Nenshi and Premier Redford expressed interest in her activism. Nenshi Chief of staff Chima Nkemdirim, suggests that Nenshi is open to dialog should she decide to take the initiative by scheduling an appointment.In 2013, the city council enacted a bylaw banning smoking in playgrounds and other places where family and children play.The length of council terms was extended from three years to four years.",
        "Calgary Police and crime": "Continuing on a downward trend of violent crimes since 1991, Calgary's together with Canada's crime rate has dropped. As of 2013 the national crime rate has dropped below levels since 1971. It is unknown what has caused the decline in violent crimes; however, Statistics Canada analyst Mary Allen correlates that communities with higher standards of socio-economic conditions tend to have low crime rates. Many other urban areas have experienced similar decreases in crime rates, and recent studies suggest this may primarily be due to decreased environmental levels of lead. Calgary has experienced significant percentage drops since 2011, such as a 23% drop in robberies. In 2012 Calgary's Crime Severity Index of 60.5 is below the national rating of 75.In 2013, community service groups and the Calgary Police Service banded together to form the Safe Communities Opportunity and Resource Centre (SCORCe) as a cooperative effort to improve effective services for vulnerable Calgarians. Nenshi opened the centre in a ceremony.\nIn September 2013, the city extended the contract of Police Chief Rick Hanson until 2017. Nenshi credits his leadership as a factor for Calgary's low crime fortunes.",
        "Enterprise and financial initiatives": "The city created the Community Investment Fund to grant $252 million between 2012 and 2016 to renovate and construct new Calgarian public recreation and community facilities such as libraries. The fund provides funding for community groups to renovate their facilities that provide services to Calgarians. The fund is composed from major sources such as annual rebate of $42 million from the Alberta government, $4 million from GST refund, and $150 million from a fund created by urban developers for community growth. The fund was a response to address the need for access for recreational services, especially sports and physical facilities for children. Such as ice rinks and swimming pools. The fund also addresses the need for renovations for many aging facilities providing essential services for Calgarians. The city will construct four new facilities providing access for 84,000 Calgarians.Nenshi approved a pilot project in 2011 for mobile food van servers.

The city operates non-tax non-profit corporation, 'Attainable Homes' which partners up businesses to help provide for impoverished Calgarian families. However the corporation was not initially Nenshi's initiative as it was founded in 2009. Mass building projects were completed and initiated during his term.During the Liberal Party caucus retreat to Calgary in 2017, Nenshi advocated for Calgary to be the base of the 'Canadian Infrastructure Bank'. He cited that Calgary was an ideal location as many talented finance professionals reside in Calgary and the decision would help create diversification of economic development into Western Canada.In 2017 during a technology trade mission to California Nenshi convinced a company to establish an office in Calgary. He states that it is a well-known company but has not as yet revealed. He also states that there have been inquiries from prospective technology companies.",
        "Taxation and city finances": "No information",
        "Increases of property tax": "As Calgary grew into a metropolis with challenging needs the city experienced typical increased incremental costs of living such as rises in property taxes. Taxes began to rise before Nenshi's government as both the provincial and city governments have increased taxes since 2007 for several years and Mayor Dave Bronconnier commissioned civic work projects, as Ctrain extension. Tax rates increased on average 5\u201310%/year for city taxes and 3\u20138%/year for provincial taxes. The increase in taxes was a source of frustration for many Calgarians over the years, especially after rising 33% during Nenshi's first three-year term, and an additional 14.37% property tax increase through three years of Nenshi's second four-year term in office.Nenshi has encountered frustrations as his council finds it difficult to budget yearly with unsecured sources of provincial and federal funding. Nenshi with other Canadian mayors rebuked the Federal government for lack of capital funding for necessary projects such as transportation infrastructure projects such as public transit and improved highways as they have in the United States.The lack of fiscal clarification from the federal and provincial government has economically damaged the city causing debt and raised erratic municipal taxes as the city struggles to secure funding for projects to maintain the city. Dave Bronconnier faced similar challenges as Nenshi managing a growing city. Nenshi is tasked with completion of Bronconnier's necessary projects such as extension of the C-train.However, Nenshi together with Stephen Mandel attempted to negotiate with Premier Alison Redford to enact a charter to replace the decades-old ambiguous Municipal Act, to better define the roles of provincial and municipal governments. As the uncertain nature of non-municipal funding is unpredictable. Redford was forced to resort to Austerity measures such as educational cutbacks early in her term. Her government is experiencing a 5-year deficit, and will go into debt as it continues infrastructural spending.Nenshi stated that taxes remained the lowest in Canada when compared to other major Canadian municipalities. However, during Nenshi's two terms in office, median property taxes were increased by 52% between 2010 and 2016.",
        "Taxation of second term": "For the 2014 budget the city voted to return the initial $52 million provincial tax refund as debated early in 2012. The refunded tax gap afforded the city to reduce an initial planned 6% increase in residential property tax to a 5% increase.In December 2013, Nenshi warned of prospective tax raises of 5% over the next four-year budget. He suggested that the best way to avoid or mitigate the increases was to implement a policy diversified sources of funding besides property taxes. Nenshi disfavours property tax as being archaic and unable to effectively collect revenue for capital civil works such as upgrading transportation. He favours a mixture of sources such as business taxes. Nenshi states that currently only the province have the authority to enact legislature that fundamentally defines sources of revenue. Nenshi and his Edmontonian mayor counterparts Stephen Mandel and Don Iveson have been negotiating with the Albertan \ngovernment to enact a city charter. The charter would clarify the responsibilities of the Municipal and Provincial governments such as taxation. Nenshi anticipates the ratification of the charter in 2014.",
        "Financial decisions": "The city implemented a 10-year plan to merge the business tax with the non-residential property tax. Until then Calgary was one of the last cities to have a stand-alone business tax. It is estimated that taxes will decrease 65% for Calgarian business over the decade and save the city $1.3 million in operational overhead.\nTowards the end of first Nenshi's term, the Manning Centre published a study entitled \"Growing the Democratic Toolbox: city council vote tracking\" by Jeromy Farkas. The research measured the performance of 2010 city council on the economic stances of councilors (taxpayer friendly scale), frequency of open meetings, and attendance of council meetings. According to the study these topics were of importance to Calgarians. Contrary to Nenshi's critics, who were frustrated with tax increases and capital spending and had nicked named Nenshi as \"Spendshi\", Farkas gauged Nenshi to be a moderate spender. Nenshi scored 50.7% and was ranked 5th out of 14 councillors on the \"Taxpayer Friendly Scale\". Nenshi's score was based on how many times he voted against motions of capital spending with a sample of 73 motions pertaining to city finance.",
        "Property tax surplus": "The city council asked Calgarians for their opinion of how to invest a $52 million surplus from an over collection of property taxes. A debate was held in May 2013 and offered five options: return the money to Calgarians as a rebate, invest in revitalizing older neighborhoods, improve Calgary Transit, reduction in taxes for businesses, and reducing the city's debt. A live debate inspired by the reality show \"Dragon's Den\" was held at the Devonian Gardens. In the wake of the devastating flood of 2013, the city council voted to implement Nenshi's proposal to use the surplus towards flood relief. However, the Canadian Taxpayer Federation warns that motion could become a permanent tax grab. That the money was intended to be returned to citizens.During deliberations of the 2014 budget majority of the councilors voted in favour of returning the 2013 provincial $52 million tax refund. The council has allocated the future $52 million per year tax refunds for the next decade towards transit options such as an express bus route entitled the 'Green Line'. The 'Green Line' is optioned for upgrading to a C-train line at a later date. The rebate will amount to $100 returned to each Calgarian household.",
        "Financial decisions of second term": "Nenshi's council have voted to halt council salary raises, and limit salaries of non-unionized city staff to 1.8% raises for 2014. According to councilors Shane Keating and Diane Colley-Urquhart economic factors decided the austerity measures.

        "2013 flood and reconstruction": "Nenshi's rally to boost morale in the wake of a devastating flood that ravaged Southern Alberta in 2013 was well received by the press and Calgarians. He urged Calgarians to seek assistance for mental distress urged support for their neighbors mental and emotional well-being during the disaster recovery. Calgarian approval from his supporters has made him the subject of internet memes parodying him as Supermayor as 2013 Summer blockbuster movie Superman.

Residents will be given $10,000 to assist with moving costs, and be given an additional $10,000 for compensation. Residents will also have access to counseling services.\nHowever some Midfield residents who have built equity with their mobile homes believe that the compensation is inadequate and worry that there may not a place to relocate to. The city decided against developing the proposed East Hills Estates, mobile home park. According to community President Rudy Prediger the secretive nature of the dealings have caused problematic worries among his neighbors. Some neighbors sold their mobile homes at a loss. Elderly Midfield residents who have deep rooted ties of affinity with the community are reluctant to move.

    "Greg Orman": {
        "Introduction": "Gregory John Orman (born December 2, 1968) is an American politician, businessman, and entrepreneur. He ran as an independent to represent Kansas in the United States Senate in the 2014 election, earning 42.5 percent of the vote and losing to incumbent U.S. Senator Pat Roberts.\nOn January 24, 2018, Orman announced he would run again as an independent this time for Kansas governor.  After the major party primaries in August 2018, polling indicated that in a three-way race Orman was at 19 percent, Democrat Laura Kelly at 32 percent and Republican Kris Kobach at 38 percent. Orman suspended his television ads and stopped actively fundraising in mid-September. In the November 6 general election, he received approximately 6.5% of the vote, 1.5% more than the victory margin of Democrat Laura Kelly over Republican Kris Kobach.",
        "Background": "Orman was born in Minneapolis, MN, raised in Mankato, Minnesota, and is the second-oldest of six children. His mother, Darlene Gates, was a registered nurse. When he was five his parents divorced. His mother got full custody of the children and later sued her ex-husband for increases in child support payments. His father, Tim, moved to Stanley, Kansas where he co-owned a furniture store. Orman lived with his mother during the school year and with his father during the summer where he worked in his father's warehouse. His mother was a Democrat and his father a Republican. As a young adult, Orman admired Ronald Reagan.Orman graduated from Mankato East Senior High School in 1987 as co-valedictorian of his class. In 1986, he was the national President of the Boys Nation and met President Reagan at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.Orman graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University in 1991 with a degree in economics and finance. He was a member of the Princeton College Republicans and worked for George H. W. Bush's presidential campaign in 1988. However, in 1992 he supported independent candidate Ross Perot.Orman currently sits as a member of the board at various charitable organizations and non-profit organizations. The list includes the grassroots political reform organization Unite America, the National Police Foundation which studies the science of policing so as to improve the relationships between police and the communities they serve, and American Public Square at Jewell College which works to improve the tone and quality of public discourse.",
        "Business career": "After graduating, Orman worked for consultancy firm McKinsey & Company. At age 23 he founded Environmental Lighting Concepts LLC, which designs and installs energy-efficient lighting systems for commercial and industrial companies. Orman built the business \"into a multi-million-dollar enterprise with 120 employees within four years.\u201d In 1996, Orman was put in charge of KLT Energy Services, a subsidiary of Kansas City Power & Light after it bought a 70 percent stake in Orman\u2019s business. Orman remained at Kansas City Power & Light for six more years and grew KLT Energy Services from less than $100 million in revenues to almost $1 billion before leaving the company in 2002.Drue Jennings, the CEO of Kansas City Power & Light at the time of their purchase of Environmental Lighting Concepts, referred to Orman as \u201cvery disciplined, and very studious, and never just took a flier at something. He had it thought through.\u201dIn 2004, Orman co-founded private equity firm Denali Partners LLC  and is the Managing Member of Exemplar Holdings, LLC. Exemplar Holdings lists six portfolio companies on its website: 1. Combat Brands, a Lenexa, Kansas-based boxing equipment manufacturer; 2. Ripple Glass, a Kansas City-based recycler of glass containers that operates in six states; 3. Exemplar Medical, which focuses on investing in companies that reduce the cost of healthcare; 4. Exemplar Finance, which provides financing for capital equipment projects utilizing energy efficient technology; 5. Dragon Jacket, a manufacturer of a patented, reusable pipe insulation product; and 6. an affordable housing subsidiary that invests in local, affordable housing communities.On December 28, 2015 Combat Brands LLC, the Orman led company, announced it acquired Kansas City-based Fitness First, Inc. Fitness First, a fitness equipment provider, was consolidated into Combat Brands, but operates under the name Fitness First.  Acquiring Fitness First would help expand Combat's product offerings and grow the company, Orman said in an interview with Kansas City Business Journal. Orman extended employment offers to all Fitness First employees.\nIn July 2020, according to the Kansas City Business Journal, Orman sold Combat Brands to its employees through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Instead of selling to a competitor which would have led to layoffs and moving operations out of Lenexa, KS, Orman said the sale \"allowed us to ultimately reward the people who had been so instrumental in helping the business be successful.\u201d  Combat Brands CEO Doug Skeens is also quoted, saying the transfer of ownership to the employees has \u201cboosted morale, employee engagement, and collaboration\u201d and \u201cgives employees financial security.\u201d Skeens referred to it as \"the highlight\" of his career.In June,1997 FRM Associates, of which Greg Orman was a partner, purchased a building that houses The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. The building today is known as \"Marquette Plaza.\" According to Business Wire, \"The building went under a multi-year renovation and addition which was completed in 2002. In 2011, the building re-established its 'iconic status' and became the first downtown Minneapolis building to earn LEED Platinum certification. This status, granted by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) is the most prestigious and challenging level of LEED certification to achieve and illustrates the building's transformation and leadership in the greening of downtown.\"  He has professional and personal ties to former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta, and served as his designated representative on the board of New Silk Route, a private equity fund, from April 2013 until March 2014. When Gupta was convicted of insider trading in 2012, Orman said that \"He is a friend of mine, he made a huge mistake, and he's paying the price for it. It shocked me like it shocked a lot of people when it came out that he was charged with those things.\" According to news reports, Gupta\u2019s conviction was unrelated to any business affiliation with Orman.",
        "Political career": "Orman has been unaffiliated with a party since 2010. At various times before that he was registered as a Republican and a Democrat. After a debate in 2014 Orman stated that, \"I've tried both parties, and, like most Kansans, I've been disappointed.\"Orman has made donations to both Democratic and Republican candidates. In 2006, while he was considering running as a Democrat for the  Senate, he gave $1,000 to Harry Reid and $4,600 to the 2008 presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Public records also show donations to the Democratic Party, Kansan United States representatives Dennis Moore and  Nancy Boyda, as well as Minnesota Democratic senator Al Franken.Orman's Republican donations include Todd Akin in 2006 and Scott Brown in 2010. \nOrman said the Scott Brown donation was made in part to block the passage of Obamacare because Orman believed that the ACA would not achieve the central goal of decreasing healthcare costs. According to the Associated Press, Orman said, \"I thought at the time we were expanding a broken system.\u201d Orman also said that later attempts by Republicans to repeal the law were impractical because Obama remained in office with veto power. The AP quotes Orman saying \u201cIt sounds like a hollow political promise they can\u2019t keep.\u201dOrman was briefly a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 U.S. Senate election in Kansas, but dropped out before the primary, saying \"Whenever you run as a candidate in either party, there are certain constituencies that want you to behave and act and believe certain things. As I evaluated the race and looked at the positions I was going to have to take to get the support that was necessary to win, I just didn't feel comfortable taking those positions.\"",
        "2014 U.S. Senate election": "Orman was an independent candidate in Kansas's 2014 U.S. Senate election. The campaign gathered enough signatures to get on the ballot as a candidate for the general election.He faced incumbent Republican Senator Pat Roberts in the November general election. Orman was the main rival to Roberts after Democrat Chad Taylor dropped out of the race on September 3 over concerns that he and Orman would split votes from Independent and Democratic voters not breaking for Roberts.The group Traditional Republicans for Common Sense endorsed Orman on September 3, 2014. This group is composed of approximately 70 former Republican elected officials. Jim Yonally, chairman of the group, stated \"We believe Greg Orman is the best qualified candidate for the office of United States senator from Kansas\", although some other members of the group expressed their support for Roberts following the announcement. During the campaign, Orman did not appear to receive significant support or help from any politicians or organizations, including Democrats.  After the election, final fundraising reports showed that groups supporting Orman had received $1.5 million from Senate Majority PAC, run by former advisors to Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid, $1 million from Independent New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and donations from GOP donors Peter Ackerman, Greg Penner, Jeffrey Binder and John Burbank.Because the makeup of the U.S. Senate might have been affected if Orman was elected, NBC News said that Orman could be \"the most interesting man in politics\" in November. If Orman had been victorious, the U.S. Senate would have had three independent senators for the first time in the chamber's history.",
        "Potential caucus affiliation": "Due to the close nature of the 2014 Senate elections, Orman could have played the role of kingmaker in choosing the Senate Majority Leader. He proposed to caucus with whichever party held the majority in the Senate, saying that \"it's in the best interests of the voters of Kansas that they have a senator in the majority\".In the event that Orman held the tiebreaking vote in the Senate, he stated that he would ask both parties to commit to issues including immigration and tax reform and caucus with whichever agreed. He said in October 2014 that if, after caucusing with one party for four or five months he found that \"they're engaged in the same old partisan politics\", he would \"absolutely\" consider caucusing with the other party to give them the majority instead. He explained: \"Ultimately, this is about solving problems. This is about the voters of Kansas saying\u2014the status quo doesn't work anymore.\"Orman stated that he voted for Obama in 2008 and voted for Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. In 2010 he founded the Common Sense Coalition to promote the voices of \"the sensible middle\".",
        "Election results": "Although Orman led incumbent Roberts in the polls in early November, Roberts defeated Orman 53% to 43%, with the balance going to another non-major party candidate. Robert's win was coined a \"rescue mission\" by the Washington Post. According to another Washington Post report, \"Roberts spent the better part of September trailing his challenger by as much as 10 points...So, the national party sent in reinforcements and replaced the people at the head of Roberts's campaign. Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul -- a galaxy of the GOP's top stars -- trotted through what is often described as a flyover state. Bob Dole, on his tour of all 105 counties in Kansas, talked about his friend, Pat. Outside groups poured in nearly $10 million to support Roberts and to oppose Orman. Other outside groups also spent nearly $6 million in negative ads against Roberts.\"On April 29, 2015, Lincoln Park Strategies released its PAAR (Percent Above Anticipated Results) report on predicted results versus actual results for the 2014 Senate elections. The report included Greg Orman's independent campaign for the U.S. Senate. The report concluded that \"Greg Orman in Kansas had the highest positive PAAR score at 10.8. Although Pat Roberts is back in Washington DC for another six years, Orman was able to drop Roberts an astronomical 12 points below what a Republican candidate was expected to receive in 2014. Governor Sam Brownback and some self-imposed mistakes clearly helped Orman, yet the campaign deserves full accolades for having the second highest PAAR score from both parties.\"",
        "Political positions": "According to Kansas Democratic Party Chairwoman Joan Wagnon, Orman and the Democratic Party have similar views in support of certain gun restrictions, reproductive rights, and other matters. Orman has described himself as \"a problem solver, not a partisan\" and describes his ideology as \"fiscally responsible and socially tolerant\". He supports \"broad tax reform\", is concerned about the impact entitlement spending is having on the federal deficit, and agrees with some of the ideas of former Republican House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan.Orman has stated that he supports campaign finance reform, by proposing expansion of campaign finance disclosure rules and contribution restrictions. He also supports a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Citizens United decision. Orman has also proposed several reforms to campaign financing, including a ban on political action committees formed by congressional leaders and a ban on PAC donations from lobbyists to candidates.Orman has declined to indicate whether he would have voted for the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. He did say, however, that \"we need to relax the Dodd\u2013Frank regulations that relate to community banks and region banks.\"Orman indicated in 2014 that he would promote oil and gas development, stating, \"I believe that we need to support continued oil and gas development.\" He also indicated he would support, \"promoting fuels like compressed natural gas and liquid natural gas and electric vehicles...\"Orman, a gun owner himself, supports universal background checks on gun sales. In an op-ed with Real Clear Politics Orman wrote, \"I am a gun owner, and I certainly don\u2019t want to impede those rights. But I also believe that we can proudly bear our arms and have responsible firearm laws. The safety of our children and citizens doesn\u2019t have to be at odds with gun ownership. It doesn\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive.\"In 2014 while running for the U.S. Senate, Orman told the Lawrence Journal-World his views on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, saying that, \"I opposed the ACA (in 2009) because it did nothing to fix a broken system. We had a national crisis in health care before the Affordable Care Act passed, and that crisis still exists today. But instead of playing political games with this issue as Republicans and Democrats in Congress have done, I believe we need to focus on what Washington can actually do to ensure that health care is affordable for all Americans.\"He also has stated he supports maintaining or increasing border patrols to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States. In addition, he supports a path to citizenship for some of the illegal immigrants already in the country.On abortion, Orman is politically \"pro-choice\".Orman, is a supporter of term limits, and promised to serve no more than two terms if he was elected to the Senate in 2014. He is also an advocate for Ranked Choice Voting, writing a 2016 op-ed title Why Ranked-Choice Voting Makes Sense. In that editorial he wrote, \"Ranked-choice voting effectively allows voters to vote their actual preferences instead of having to vote strategically. This would have a meaningful impact on elections and governing. It would empower independent and third party candidates by eliminating the \u201cwasted vote\u201d argument.\" \"A ranked-choice system would force major party candidates to broaden their appeal to compete for second-choice votes. Candidates could only get elected by appealing to a majority of voters. Negative campaigning would likely decline.\"",
        "2016 book release": "On May 3, 2016, Greg Orman's book A Declaration of Independents, How We Can Break the Two-Party Stranglehold and Restore the American Dream, published through the Greenleaf Book Group, went on sale. In the book Orman described his view on how hyper-partisanship, division and a win-at-all-costs environment in Washington have created a toxic culture of self-interest that has left average Americans behind.\nMorton Kondracke praised the book in his 2015 Wall Street Journal book review. He said, \"[Orman] argues passionately and convincingly that a third force is necessary to challenge the Republican-Democrat \"duopoly\" that sustains a status quo of laws, regulations, subsidies and loopholes paid for by special-interest contributions to both parties.\"Charles Wheelan, a senior lecturer and policy fellow at the Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College and contributing writer for U.S. News & World Report wrote in his review, \"I hope this will be the first shot in a sustained assault on the broken two-party system. Orman is not a political scientist hunkered down in the Ivory Tower. Nor is he a vapid politician...He's a guy who ran a U.S. Senate campaign that nearly upended the political system.\"",
        "2018 gubernatorial election": "Orman filed to run as an independent in the 2018 Kansas governor's race with state senator John Doll. Doll was formerly a Republican House and then Senate member who changed his registration to independent in 2018 to run as Orman's lieutenant gubernatorial running mate. After submitting more than 10,000 signatures, twice the amount needed to appear on the November general election ballot, an objection was raised and then debated in front of the Kansas Board of Objections. Ultimately, only 323 signatures were deemed ineligible by the state Objections Board and Orman was granted ballot access for the November election. The Objections Board consisted of statewide Republican officials, Attorney General Derek Schmidt,  Governor Jeff Colyer, and Secretary of State, Kris Kobach. All three were represented at the board by their proxies. Colyer and Kobach were candidates for governor, with the latter winning the Republican primary by 343 votes. Colyer's campaign chairman, Steve Baccus, a long time President of Kansas Farm Bureau endorsed Orman after the Republican primary and became a campaign co-chairman for Orman.Immediately after the major party primaries, polling in a three-way race indicated that Orman was at 19 percent, trailing Democrat Laura Kelly by 13 points and Republican Kris Kobach by 19 points. There was some media attention in the early stages of the general election because additional polling showed Orman outperforming Kelly in a hypothetical head-to-head showdown against Kobach. Polling done by Triton Research and reported on by the Topeka Capital Journal showed Orman would beat Kobach in a head-to-head race by 13 percentage points, while Democrat Kelly was in a dead heat. The race eventually became about which candidate, Orman or Kelly, was more likely to beat Kobach in a three-way race. According to senior staff on the Orman campaign, [despite] \u201cgreat Orman debate performances, innovative policies, and a compelling message, we just couldn't sell Greg's electability argument. We couldn't get Kansans past the fear of accidentally electing Kobach.\u201d  In polling released by the Docking Institute at Fort Hays State University in October 2018, Orman had a net positive favorability rating and significantly higher name ID than Laura Kelly (75% for Orman and 62% for Kelly). However, a significant number more said they planned to vote for Kelly. Orman suspended active fundraising efforts and elected to stop running TV advertisements in the Kansas City market by Labor Day. He stopped running ads in the rest of the state in mid-September.In a poll conducted on September 12\u201313, Orman, at 9% trailed Kobach and Democratic State Senator Laura Kelly, each by about 30 points. By September 18, 2018, dozens of prominent Republicans had endorsed Kelly, including former Governor Bill Graves, former U.S. Senators Sheila Frahm and Nancy Kassebaum, and former Kansas Senate President Dick Bond.Despite significant calls for Orman to drop out of the Governor's race and support Laura Kelly, he elected to stay in. He described his reasons for doing so in an article published post-election. Among others, Orman wrote, \u201cBecause I believe the most important issue facing us as Americans is our destructive and self-perpetuating two-party system, I was not willing to join it in the service of personal advancement.\u201d",
        "Personal life": "Orman lives in Fairway, Kansas with his wife Sybil and their two young daughters. He moved to Kansas in 1997, where he was registered as a Republican.",

His father, Steven Orszag, was a math professor at Yale University and his mother was the president and owner of a research and development company. His brother is Jonathan Orszag, the Senior Managing Director of Compass Lexecon, LLC.\nAfter graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy with high honors (1987), Orszag earned an A.B. summa cum laude in economics from Princeton University in 1991 after completing an 80-page long senior thesis titled \"Congressional Oversight of the Federal Reserve: Empirical and Theoretical Perspectives.\" He then received a M.Sc. (1992) and a Ph.D. (1997) in economics from the London School of Economics. His doctoral thesis was titled Dynamic analysis of regime shifts under uncertainty: Applications to hyperinflation and privatization. He was a Marshall Scholar 1991\u20131992, and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.",
        "Career": "Orszag became a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, and taught macroeconomics in 1999 and 2000. As a senior fellow and Deputy Director of Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, he co-founded and directed The Hamilton Project and (in conjunction with Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute) the Pew Charitable Trust's Retirement Security Project.He served as Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (1997\u20131998), and as Senior Economist and Senior Adviser on the Council of Economic Advisers (1995\u20131996) during the Clinton administration. He also formed a consulting group called Sebago Associates, which merged into Competition Policy Associates and was bought by FTI Consulting Inc. for a reported $70 million.After leaving the Obama administration, Orszag took a job with Citigroup. A 2011 article in New York Magazine suggested Citi's hiring of Orszag \"signaled that Citi would be invested in the intellectual marketplace,\" and that \"just about anyone will take the call of a former White House budget director.\" In May 2016, Orszag joined Lazard as managing director and vice chairman of investment banking.He is also an invitee of the Bilderberg Group and attended the conferences in 2010, 2011 and 2012.",
        "Congressional Budget Office": "Orszag was director of the Congressional Budget Office from January 2007 to November 2008. During his tenure, he repeatedly drew attention to the role rising health care expenditures are likely to play in the government's long-term fiscal problems\u2014and, by extension, the nation's long-term economic problems. \"I have not viewed CBO's job as just to passively evaluate what Congress proposes, but rather to be an analytical resource. And part of that is to highlight things that are true and that people may not want to hear, including that we need to address health-care costs.\" During his time at the CBO, he added 20 full-time health analysts (bringing the total number to 50), thereby strengthening the CBO's analytical capabilities and preparing Congress for health-care reform.He was widely praised for his time at CBO for preparing the agency for the debates to come.  When he stepped down, National Journal noted that \"Orszag, who will turn 40 on Dec. 16, has been praised by lawmakers from both parties as an objective analyst with deep knowledge of the most pressing fiscal issues of the day, including health care policy, Social Security, pensions, and global climate change. He is the unusual economist who blends an understanding of politics, policy and communications in ways that wrap zesty quotes around complex ideas.\"",
        "Office of Management and Budget": "On November 25, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama announced that Orszag would be his nominee for director of the Office of Management and Budget, the arm of the White House responsible for crafting the federal budget and overseeing the effectiveness of federal programs.\nOrszag, in a November 2009 speech in New York, said that deficits, which were expected to add $9 trillion to the existing national debt of $12 trillion over the next decade, are \"serious and ultimately unsustainable.\" He said that deficit spending was necessary to help boost the economy when unemployment is hovering around 10 percent. But he said that red ink must be stopped as the economy recovers. During a recovery, private investment will again pick up and compete with the federal government for capital. In 2011, he was described by New York Magazine as a \"deficit hawk and clashed with Larry Summers, who wasn\u2019t as focused on the long-term debt crisis.\"In July 2010 Orszag said that \"The problem now is weak growth and high unemployment rather than outright economic collapse\". Still, the deficit would be equivalent to 10 percent of the gross domestic product, the highest level since World War II. The Office of Management and Budget's mid-session review, forecast a smaller deficit and stronger economic growth than the administration's initial budget release. The deficit forecast in 2011 increased to $1.42 trillion, up from the $1.27 estimate in February. For 2012, the deficit estimate rose to $922 billion, up from $828 billion in the previous report. The annual budget shortfall would bottom out in 2017 at $721 billion, or 3.4 percent of GDP, and begin rising again in following years.A review of Orszag's daily schedules shows his sustained focus on healthcare reform as soon as he joined Obama's Cabinet. The daily schedules for Orszag, who left his position as OMB director in July 2010, reveal that he and key White House aides regularly met to discuss healthcare starting in January 2009, within days of Obama entering office. Orszag also had meetings with insurance executives and health experts as the White House made health reform its top legislative priority after enacting the $814 billion stimulus from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\nWhen Orszag resigned, the Progressive Policy Institute summed up his time in office: \"For an administration numbers-cruncher, he was unusually visible, which was a good thing. With a reputation for impartiality and brilliance, Orszag gave the administration's agenda analytical ballast. There will no doubt be efforts on the right to brush Orszag with the red ink that the administration finds itself swimming in, but that's politics as usual. Inheriting the worst economy since the 1930s, Orszag presided over the Herculean task of preventing a complete meltdown and setting the foundation for a recovery. In many ways, he's a reflection of the administration at its best: a rigorous, pragmatic empiricist.\"",
        "Citigroup": "Orszag held two jobs at Citigroup: Vice Chairman of Corporate and Investment Banking and Chairman of the Financial Strategy and Solutions Group. He joined Citigroup in 2011.  According to New York Magazine, \"for an ambitious economist like Peter Orszag, going to work for Citigroup represented a choice. As a young staffer working in the Clinton White House, he saw laid before him two different paths: Stiglitzism and Rubinism. There were both intellectual and career-arc components to these. While both are liberal Democrats, Rubin was the consummate insider, whose philosophy was that the free markets, balanced budgets, and limited regulation would create a rising tide that would lift all boats (or at least make Wall Street not complain too much about Clinton's social programs). Stiglitz, the public intellectual, is as concerned with the boats as with the tide. Orszag certainly had a lot in common with Stiglitz's academic mien, having grown up in an intensely intellectual family in Lexington, Massachusetts, outside Boston. His father was the celebrated Yale math professor Steven Orszag. But Orszag possessed an ambition that would take him beyond the ivory tower. He ultimately chose Rubinism. It makes perfect sense that Orszag would have been drawn toward Rubin. It must have been incredibly seductive seeing this world, watching the Rubin wing of the Democratic Party move so easily from government to Wall Street boardrooms to the table with Charlie Rose.\"",
        "Lazard": "In May 2016, Orszag joined Lazard as Vice Chairman of investment banking and Managing Director. He was later named Global Co-Head of Healthcare and, subsequent to that, Head of North American M&A. Orszag took over as CEO of Financial Advisory in June 2019, overseeing the firm's advisory work for corporations and governments across the globe. Orszag has been charged with \"breathing new life into Lazard\" as the firm faces increased competition from copycat advisory firms. As CEO, Orszag led Lazard's team of advisors who worked with Argentina's government during the country's $65 billion sovereign debt restructuring in 2020.",
        "Personal life": "Orszag's first wife was Cameron Rachel Hamill. They had two children before divorcing. In 2009, he fathered a child with his former girlfriend, Claire Milonas, daughter of shipping magnate Spiros Milonas. In 2010, Orszag married Bianna Golodryga, then co-host of ABC's GMA Weekend. They have a son and a daughter. Orszag is Jewish. In 2014, Orszag won a protracted, contentious child support case brought by Hamill (who had since changed her name to Kennedy).  The judge rejected Kennedy's case against Orszag.",

    "J. Michael Pearson": {
        "Introduction": "J. Michael Pearson (born 1959) is a Canadian American pharmaceutical company executive. He is the former chairman and CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International after being ousted in the aftermath of a report on pharmaceutical pricing published by Citron Research in April 2016.On April 27, 2016, Pearson, Bill Ackman and Howard Schiller appeared before the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging to answer concerns over the repercussions for patients and the health care system whom are affected by Valeant's business model.In 2017, Pearson sued Valeant Pharmaceuticals for $31 million as compensation for his alleged wrongful termination as CEO and chairman.  In December 2017, a New Jersey judge ruled that Pearson should pursue his claim by arbitration rather than through the courts.",
        "Early life and education": "Pearson was born in London, Ontario, Canada. His father worked for Bell Canada and \"helped design the phone lines in some of the small towns\" and also worked at global consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Pearson moved to New Jersey with his family when he was 12 years old.In 1981, he graduated summa cum laude from Duke University, where he earned his BS and BSE; he was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.  He then earned an MBA from the University of Virginia Darden Graduate School of Business Administration.",
        "Career": "Pearson joined McKinsey & Company in 1985 and worked as a consultant there for 23 years before rising to the position of director.",
        "Valeant Pharmaceuticals International": "See Valeant Pharmaceuticals\nBefore taking over as the CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2008, Pearson worked for them as an outside consultant in 2007. In 2008, Pearson began implementing his strategy by selling off portions of Valeant's European business to Meda AB.  In 2010, Valeant and the Canadian-headquartered company Biovail agreed to merge; the resulting company was named Valeant and its headquarters are in Mississauga, Ontario. Pearson was named CEO of the new company and in March 2011 was appointed chairman of the board. The Biovail merger allowed the company to reduce its tax rate to approximately 5% by situating its headquarters in Canada. Later, Valeant would be called upon to testify before Congress, along with Burger King, about how its tax inversion potentially gave it a competitive advantage over American companies. A New York Times article credits Pearson's \"tough tactics\" for the financial success of the \"fast-growing\" Valeant. The article also highlights the criticism that Valeant Pharmaceuticals' controversial strategy attracted patients who are finding themselves unable to afford drugs after price hikes by Valeant. This pricing controversy was originally raised when Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings sent a letter to Valeant seeking justification for huge price increases it put on two life-saving drugs: Nitropress and Isuprel. The company had raised the price of Isuprel by almost six times and the price of Nitropress by over three times. Shortly after, Democratic members of Congress attempted to subpoena Valeant for this information. As CEO, Pearson's business strategy was to eliminate \"risky and inefficient\" Research and Development to the equivalent of \"only 3 percent of its sales\" whereas \"traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20 percent of sales on research and development\". Instead, he acquired dozens of companies with existing drugs and saved money by laying off their employees. This model worked and Valeant's stock price rose by over 1000%. By 2013, under Pearson's tenure, Valeant became the largest pharmaceutical company in Canada. By 2015 Pearson had \"nearly $US 3 billion in stock and options\" in Valeant, with \"the potential to own hundreds of millions of dollars more.\" Since Pearson became CEO, Valeant shares \"have returned more than 2,300 per cent\" making Valeant the \"most valuable\" performer on the Toronto Stock Exchange. By July 2015, Valeant's market capitalization was $CDN 113 billion, which is about $4 billion more than the Royal Bank of Canada. However, by October of that same year, negative press surrounding its pricing tactics and a particularly negative analyst report from Citron Research dropped Valeant's stock to approximately $CDN 78 billion.In a conference call with Valeant investors on October 19, Pearson announced changes in Valeant's business strategy: they were to spend \"more on research and development and less on acquisitions of smaller drug makers\" and that there would be \"minimal price increases on its products\" in 2016.Pearson was hospitalized on December 25 and treated for severe pneumonia. Valeant's board created an office of the Chief Executive Officer to immediately take over his duties and a supporting committee to oversee the office of the CEO. The committee included Robert Ingram, president of ValueAct Capital Mason Morfit, and former Valeant CFO Howard Schiller. According to Reuters, Valeant shares fell \"10.5 percent to $102.14\" after the announcement on the New York Stock Exchange, after its stock had already fallen more than 60 percent since August. Industry critics claim that since Valeant has suffered from credibility issues over the pricing controversy and is still not on solid ground, the company needs strong decisive leadership and not a \"cumbersome\" committee.On February 29, 2016, Pearson returned to the company. On March 15, shares in the company dropped by 50 percent following a disastrous earnings call fronted by Pearson. On March 21, 2016, Valeant reported that CEO Pearson would be leaving the company, a decision that, as reported by CNBC, \"was not mutual\". The company also reported that former CFO Howard Schiller was to blame for \"improper conduct\" and requested he resign from the board of directors, which Schiller declined to do. Piper Jaffray & Co analysts led by David Amsellem described it as a \"circular firing squad\".On April 13, 2016 it was announced that Pearson would be deposed from his position as CEO of Valeant on April 18, 2016. The removal was ordered by the Senate Special Committee on Aging who have been probing the soaring price of prescription drugs. Pearson initially fought the decision before Valeant's board directed him to comply.",
        "Controversies": "No information",
        "Tax rate": "Valeant's conversion to a Canadian company via the Valeant/Biovail merger in 2010 allowed the company to reduce its corporate tax rate to approximately 5%. Congress used Burger King and Valeant as examples of companies with tax advantages in a July 2015 investigation of corporate taxation. The investigation primarily focused on the advantage that foreign companies have in acquiring American companies due to their low tax rates, and members of Congress suggested that many of the deals by foreign companies, including Valeant, relied upon tax advantages to be completed. During the testimony, Valeant CFO Howard Schiller stated that \"Valeant does not take into account tax synergies in either identifying or pricing potential acquisition targets\", but articles suggested this was in contrast to previous comments made by Pearson, including a comment made during Valeant's pursuit of Allergan in a hostile takeover attempt when he was quoted as saying \"no other potential acquirer of Allergan has the...tax synergies we have\".",
        "Pricing": "When pharmaceutical pricing tactics became a topic for the press and politicians in 2015, Valeant's price increase history became a major focus, with investigations revealing that the company had applied substantial price increases on many products from 2013 through 2015, including two products that it acquired and then raised the price 525% and 212% the same day. In response to inquiries about these price increases, Valeant's company spokesperson said \"Our duty is to our shareholders and to maximize value\".Pearson agreed to appear before a US Senate committee investigating the matter in April 2016.",
        "Accounting tactics": "Many have accused Pearson's strategy at Valeant of being a roll-up dependent on acquisitions and aggressive accounting tactics while others claim it is not. As Valeant's debt reached roughly $30 billion by 2016, concerns continued to be raised about Valeant's accounting practices. Notable critics of Valeant and its accounting practices include Jim Chanos, who predicted the fall of Enron; Herb Greenberg; John Hempton; Charlie Munger; Jim Grant; AZ Value Investing; and Citron Research. Notable defenders of Valeant against these allegations include activist investors Bill Ackman and Jeffrey Ubben. Valeant defended itself against these allegations in an SEC filing in October 2015. Pearson has stated \u201cif products are sort of mispriced and there\u2019s an opportunity, we will act appropriately in terms of doing what I assume our shareholders would like us to do.\u201dPearson was the highest paid CEO in Canada in 2015; he received US $182.9 million during a period when Valeant's share price fell by 30%.",
        "SEC Settlement": "On July 31, 2020 the SEC announced that they had determined that Pearson and others had \"misstated revenue transactions and included erroneous revenue allocations.\" Pearson agreed to pay civil penalties of $250,000, and to reimburse Valeant $450,000, representing a portion of his incentive compensation.",
        "Philanthropy": "In 2011, Pearson donated $15 million to the Duke University School of Nursing on behalf of his wife who graduated from Duke University School of Nursing in 1984. In honor of this gift, the school named their main facility the Christine Siegler Pearson Building. In 2014, he donated $30 million to Duke's Edmund T. Pratt Jr. School of Engineering where he graduated in 1981. The $30 million contribution in 2014 placed the Pearsons as fourth on Duke Forward's list of largest contributors. To make this donation, Pearson had previously taken a $100 million loan from Goldman Sachs, who later demanded repayment of the loan in April 2014. They had previously donated $7.5 million to the Fuqua School of Business.",
        "Personal life": "Pearson was married to Christine Siegler with four children. However, in 2013, Christine sued her husband for a divorce. Pearson had appeared on a Florida magazine with another woman several years before as a \"couple\". His son, Morgan Pearson, is an Olympic silver medalist in the triathlon."

In 1998, he was in charge of research at the Bow Group - a UK-based independent think tank, promoting conservative opinion internationally.",
        "Parliamentary career": "Penrose unsuccessfully contested the seat of Ealing Southall in the 1997 general election, before unsuccessfully contesting the seat of Weston-super-Mare in 2001. He was elected in the same seat in the 2005 general election, defeating the Liberal Democrat Brian Cotter and he retained his seat in the 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 general elections. He served on the Work and Pensions Committee from July 2005 to January 2009, and in 2006 was appointed joint chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Further Education and Lifelong Learning. In 2006 he was also appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Oliver Letwin MP and in 2009 was promoted to Shadow Minister for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.\nAfter his re-election in 2010 and the formation of the coalition government, Penrose served as the Minister for Tourism and Heritage from 2010 to 2012 during which he wrote and implemented the Government's Tourism Strategy, removed licences on live entertainment sold the Tote bookmaker and protected the Lloyd's of London building with a 'Grade 1' listing.Penrose returned to the backbenches in 2012. He wrote a paper (We Deserve Better) on how to give people a better deal on their utilities. Less than a year later the Prime Minister invited Penrose back to a Government role with a new position as Assistant Whip (HM Treasury), before he was promoted in February 2014 as one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury (Whip). In May 2015 he became Parliamentary Secretary for the Constitution, a role he held until July 2016.He was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum. Since the result was announced, Penrose supported the official position of his party as an advocate of leaving the European Union.Penrose was a Minister of State in the Northern Ireland Office from November 2018 to July 2019.He was appointed the Prime Minister\u2019s Anti-Corruption Champion in December 2017, and then reappointed in July 2019.He came under criticism for voting to change lobbying rules in order to defend his Conservative colleague Owen Paterson, who had been found to have \"repeatedly used his privileged position to benefit two companies for whom he was a paid consultant\". One of the companies that Paterson was paid to lobby for, Randox, was awarded contracts from the Department of Health and Social Care during the pandemic. Penrose defended the government's issuing of such contracts to Conservative donors, associates and inexperienced companies. The High Court also ruled illegal the Prime Minister's appointment of Dido Harding, Penrose's wife, to Chair the National Institute for Health Protection, overseeing the Test and Trace initiative; the scheme cost \u00a337bn which was allocated to Serco and other private companies, before it failed in its primary objectives.In October 2020 he attracted media attention by suggesting that \u201cchaotic parents\u201d are to blame for sending their children to school hungry.Penrose resigned as the Anti-Corruption Champion on 6 June 2022, the same day as the vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson. He said he could not defend \"a fundamental breach of the ministerial code.\" He also confirmed he would be voting against Johnson in the vote of no confidence",
        "Personal life": "Penrose met Dido Harding (who was made Baroness Harding of Winscombe in 2014), only daughter of Lord Harding of Petherton, while both worked at McKinsey. The couple married in October 1995, and have two daughters. Penrose has his home in the Weston-super-Mare constituency and a flat in London. Harding is the Chair of NHS Improvement, former Chief Executive of TalkTalk Group.In 2016, Penrose, who lives in Winscombe, North Somerset, caused some local controversy over the design of a proposed swimming pool complex at his home. Winscombe and Sandford Parish Council formally objected to the 'ugly and massive' design on the grounds it would harm local views. The Daily Telegraph reported that this was noteworthy as Penrose had argued in 2013, in a previous ministerial role, for greater protection of historic views, suggesting some of the finest urban views in the country should be listed like buildings. Ultimately, the district council approved the planning application and accepted the argument that an originally planned grass roof was not possible.\nIn May 2020, Penrose joined the advisory board of the think tank 1828 which has campaigned to scrap the NHS and replace it with a health insurance based system."

        "Introduction": "Thomas J. Peters (born November 7, 1942) is an American writer on business management practices, best known for In Search of Excellence (co-authored with Robert H. Waterman Jr.)",
        "Life and education": "Peters was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He went to Severn School, a private, preparatory high school, graduating in 1960. Peters then attended Cornell University, receiving a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1964, and a master's degree in 1966.\nHe returned to academia in 1970 to study business at Stanford Business School receiving an MBA followed by a PhD in Organizational Behavior in 1977. The title of his dissertation was \"Patterns of Winning and Losing: Effects on Approach and Avoidance by Friends and Enemies.\" Karl Weick credited Peters' dissertation with giving him the idea for his 1984 article: \"Small wins: Redefining the scale of social problems.\"While at Stanford, Peters was influenced by Jim G. March, Herbert Simon (both at Stanford), and Karl Weick (at the University of Michigan). Later, he noted that he was influenced by Douglas McGregor and Einar Thorsrud.In 2004, he also received an honorary doctorate from the State University of Management in Moscow.",
        "Career": "From 1966 to 1970, he served in the United States Navy, making two deployments to Vietnam as a Navy Seabee, then later working in the Pentagon.  From 1973 to 1974, he worked in the White House as a senior drug-abuse advisor, during the Nixon administration. Peters has acknowledged the influence of military strategist Colonel John Boyd on his later writing.\nFrom 1974 to 1981, Peters worked as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, becoming a partner and Organization Effectiveness practice leader in 1979. In 1981, he left McKinsey to become an independent consultant.\nIn 1990, Peters was referred to in a British Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) publication as one of the world's Quality Gurus.\nIn 1995, the New York Times referred to Peters as one of the top three business experts in the highest demand as a speaker along with Daniel Burrus and Roger Blackwell.By 2000, Peters was noted for his ever-increasingly aggressive and sometimes \"crackpot\" demeanor while at the same time his target audiences had changed towards the considerably lower ranks of SMI management.In 2017, \"Thinkers50\" awarded Peters with its Lifetime Achievement Award for his paving the way for the \"thought leadership\" and business book industries.",
        "In Search of Excellence": "The publication of the popular business book In Search of Excellence in 1982 marked a turning point in Peters' career.\nPeters states that directly after graduating with a PhD from Stanford in 1977, and returning to McKinsey, the new managing director, Ron Daniel, handed him a \"fascinating assignment.\" Motivated by the new ideas coming from Bruce Henderson's Boston Consulting Group, Daniel noted that businesses often failed to effectively implement new strategies, so Peters \"was asked to look at 'organization effectiveness' and 'implementation issues' in an inconsequential offshoot project nested in McKinsey's rather offbeat San Francisco office.\"In Search of Excellence]]  became a bestseller, gaining exposure in the United States at a national level when a series of television specials based on the book and hosted by Peters appeared on PBS. The primary ideas espoused solving business problems with as little business-process overhead as possible, and empowering decision-makers at multiple levels of a company.\nThe December 2001 issue of Fast Company quoted Peters admitting that he and Waterman had falsified the underlying data for In Search of Excellence. He is quoted as saying, \" This is pretty small beer, but for what it's worth, okay, I confess: We faked the data. A lot of people suggested it at the time.\" He later insisted that this was untrue and that he was the victim of an \"aggressive headline.\"",
